==============
Using a PC's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issues

    Mini outline:
        . Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
        . X terminals
        . NeXT
        . Silicon Graphics
        . IBM RS/
	. Other stuff

    . Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port

	If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard
	(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding
	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation
	runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used
	PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable
	to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read
	the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.

	The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and AX.

	ax is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and
	even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server
	extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension).  To find out if your
	server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings
	appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,
	you may want to investigate compiling XR, patchlevel  or later,
	or bugging your vendor.

	kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.
	Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.

	Both ax and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.

    . X terminals

	Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use
	PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all
	set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the
	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add
	extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around
	for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.

    . NeXT

	NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop
	Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they
	were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of
	upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!

    . Silicon Graphics

	Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^ and
	beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't
	believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not
	possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by
	upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more
	details.

    . IBM RS/

	IBM RS/ keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||
	Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||
	cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||
	smaller PS/ style DIN-, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||
	it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||
	works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||
	told Judy Hume () - is a potential contact.  If you learn ||
	anything new, please send me e-mail.				    ||
    
    . Other stuff

	Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)
	support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your
	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can
	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either
	from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in
	luck.  Contact the companies for more details.


Apple Adjustable Keyboard
    Apple Computer, Inc.
    Sales offices all over the place.

    Availability: February, 
    Price: $
    Supports: Mac only

    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The
    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate
    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are
    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.

    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.
    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.

    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not
    directly attachable to the keyboard.

    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from
    TidBITS available there.


FlexPro Keyboard
    Key Tronic
    Phone: --
    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, --
    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops

    Availability: Spring,  (?)
    Price: $ (?)
    Supports: PC only (highly likely)

    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's
    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both
    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.
    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal -key PC keyboard.

    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will
    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.


DragonDictate-K (and numerous other Dragon products)
    Dragon Systems, Inc.
     Nevada Street
    Newton, MA  

    Phone: -TALK-TYP or --
    Fax: --

    Shipping: Now.

    Price: DragonDictate-K -- $ (end user system)
	   DragonWriter  -- $ / $ (end user/developer system)
	   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.
    
    Compatibility:  (or higher) PC only
		   (rd party support for Mac)

	Free software support for X windows is also available -- your
	PC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a
	serial cable or network.  The program is called ax, and is
	available via anonymous ftp:

	soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/ax.tar.Z
	export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/ax.tar.Z (most current)

	If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want
	to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about
	this sort of thing.

    Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.
    Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles
    (including PS/'s and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you
    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number
    of popular word processors and spreadsheets.

    Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions
    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple
    people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file
    for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.
    On the DragonDictate-K you need to pause /th sec between
    words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of - words per minute.
    I don't have specs on the DragonWriter .

    The DragonDictate-K can recognize , words at a time.
    The DragonWriter  can recognize (you guessed it)  words at a time.

    Dragon's technology is also part of the following products
    (about which I have no other info):

	Microsoft Windows Sound System (Voice Pilot)
	IBM VoiceType
	Voice Navigator II (by Articulate Systems -- for Macintosh)
	EMStation (by Lanier Voice Products -- "emergency medical workstation")

    Infogrip, Inc.
     North Blvd.
    Baton Rouge, Louisiana , U.S.A.

    Ward Bond (main contact)
    David Vicknair (did the Unix software)  --

    Shipping: Now.

    Supports: Mac, IBM PC (serial port -- native keyboard port version
    coming very soon...).  No other workstations supported, but serial
    support for Unix with X Windows has been written.  PC and Mac are
    getting all the real attention from the company.

    A chording system.  One hand is sufficient to type everything.
    The second hand is for redundancy and increased speed.

    Price:
	$ (dual set -- each one is a complete keyboard by itself)
	$ (single)

	(cheaper prices were offered at MacWorld Expo as a show-special.)


DataHand   --
    Industrial Innovations, Inc.
     North th Street
    Scottsdale, Arizona -, U.S.A.

    Mark Roggenbuck (contact)

    Supports: PC and Mac

    Shipping: In beta.  "Big backlog" -- could take + months.

    Price: $/unit ( unit ==  pods). (new price!)			    ||

    Each hand has its own "pod".  Each of the four main fingers has five
    switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down.  The thumbs have
    a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles
    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is
    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod
    tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

    (see also: the detailed review, written by Cliff Lasser <cal@THINK.COM>
     available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu)


Comfort Keyboard System   --
    FAX: --

    Health Care Keyboard Company
    N W Appleton Ave
    Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin  U.S.A.


    Jeffrey Szmanda (Vice President -- contact)

    Shipping: Now.

    Supports: PC (and Mac???)						    ||
    
    Planned future support:
	IBM -key layout (-style, I believe)
	Sun Sparc
	Decision Data
	Unisys UTS-
	Silicon Graphics

	Others to be supported later.  The hardware design is relatively
	easy for the company to re-configure.

    Price: $, including one system "personality module".		    ||

    The idea is that one keyboard works with everything.  You purchase
    "compatibility modules", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and
    then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.

    It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the
    standard -key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each
    section is on a "custom telescoping universal mount."  Each section
    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each
    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three
    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each
    section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections
    flat, and you have what looks like a normal -key keyboard).


Kinesis Ergonomic Keyboard   --
    -- (fax)

    Kinesis Corporation
     Pacific Highway South,
    Seattle, Washington , U.S.A.

    Shirley Lunde (VP Marketing -- contact)

    Shipping: Now.

    Supports: PC.  Mac and Sun Sparc in the works.

    Price: $.  Volume discounts available.  The $ includes one foot
	pedal, one set of adhesive wrist pads, and a TypingTutor program.
	An additional foot pedal and other accessories are extra.

    The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the
    keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly
    smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize
    finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,
    backspace, etc.).

    You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't
    allow the reconfig).

    Foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the
    keyboard (shift, control, whatever).

	   The cost is less for BBC computers, and they have a number of 
	   accessories, including carrying cases, switch boxes to use both
	   your normal keyboard and the Maltron, an articulated arm that
	   clamps on to your table, and training 'courses' to help you learn
	   to type on your Maltron.

	   You can also rent a keyboard for  pounds/week + taxes.
	   U.S. price: $/month, and then $ off purchase if you want it.

    Maltron has four main products -- a two-handed keyboard, two one-handed
    keyboards, and a keyboard designed for handicapped people to control with
    a mouth-stick.

    The layout allocates more buttons to the thumbs, and is curved to
    bring keys closer to the fingers.  A separate keypad is in the middle.

    Cost: $ + shipping.
 
    Doesn't use conventional push-keys.  Soft rubber keys, which rock
    forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for
    typing keys.  Learning time is estimated to be - hours, for getting
    started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it.

    Currently, the thumbs don't do anything, although a thumb-trackball
    is in the works.
 
    The company claims it takes about a week of work to support a
    new computer.  They will be happy to adapt their keyboard to
    your computer, if possible.


Twiddler	--, or --
    Handykey

    Mt. Sinai, NY 

    Chris George (President)

    Shipping: now.

    Price: $.

    Supports: PC only.  Mac and X Windows in the works.

    The Twiddler is both a keyboard and a mouse, and it fits in one hand.
    You type via finger chords.  Shift, control, etc. are thumb buttons.
    When in "mouse" mode, tilting the Twiddler moves the mouse, and mouse
    buttons are on your fingers.

    The cabling leaves your normal keyboard available, also.

    Most applications work, and Windows works fine.  DESQview has trouble.
    GEOWorks also has trouble -- mouse works, keyboard doesn't.


Braille 'n Speak     --
    Blazie Engineering
     Mill Green Rd.
    Street, Md , U.S.A.

    (information provided by Doug Martin <martin@nosc.mil>)

    The Braille N Speak uses any of several Braille codes for entering
    information: Grade I, Grade II, or computer Braille.  Basically,
    letters a-j are combinations of dots , , , and .  Letters k-t are
    the same combinations as a-j with dot  added. Letters u, v, x, y, and
    z are like a-e with dots  and  added.  (w is unique because Louis
    Braille didn't have a w in the French alphabet.)

	  For their own system: $ (DOS software) + "a few hundred dollars"
    
    Shipping: these are custom-made, so an occupational therapist would
	  make moulds/do whatever to make it for you.  You can buy one now.
    
    Supports: PC only, although the InfoGrip-compatible version might
	  work with a Mac.

    In a one-handed version, there is exactly one button per finger.  In a
    two-handed version, you get four buttons per finger, and the thumbs
    don't do anything.  You can also get one-handed versions with three
    thumb buttons -- compatible with the InfoGrip Bat.  Basically, get it
    any way you want.

    They also have a software tutorial to help you learn the chording.

    Works on a PC under DOS, not Windows.  Planning on Macintosh and
    PC/Windows support.  No work has been done on a Unix version, yet.
