Of course, the list has to agree with the nickname laws laid down by the
GIPU almost  years ago (you know... the  of them that were written on
the iron tablets that melted once and had to be reinscribed?).  Since I am
a prophet of the GIPU I decree that you should post the whole list of
nicknames for the frequent posters here!
