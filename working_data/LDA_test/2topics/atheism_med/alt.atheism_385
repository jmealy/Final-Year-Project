Hmm, USENET got it's collective hooks into me around  or so right after I
switched to engineering.  I'd say I started reading alt.atheism around -.
I've probably not posted more than  messages in the time since then though.
I'll never understand how people can find the time to write so much.  I
can barely keep up as it is.
