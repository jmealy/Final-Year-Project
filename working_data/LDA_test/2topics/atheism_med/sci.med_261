 
HEY, KEEP YOUR FU---NG FLAMING OUT OF THIS GROUP- THAT GOES FOR YOU, MR.
DYER, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER NASTY, SARCASTIC PEOPLE, REGARDING THIS
SUBJECT.  Shoot, now I'm all riled up, too, and I was just going to ask if
we can keep our discussion about MSG a little more civil; blasting a school
or an idea through simple insults as demonstrated above is not necessary,
and otherwise out of line.  If you want to continue your insult war, take
it elsewhere and stop wasting everyone else's time.
Most sincerely,
	Dan Checkman
