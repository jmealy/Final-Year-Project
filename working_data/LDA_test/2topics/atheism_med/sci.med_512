                           PURPOSE
This, the First International Conference on Intelligent Systems 
for Molecular Biology, is the inaugural meeting in a series 
intended to bring together scientists who are applying the 
technologies of artificial intelligence, robotics, machine 
learning, massively parallel computing, advanced data modelling, 
and related methods to problems in molecular biology.  The scope 
extends to any computational or robotic system supporting a 
biological task that is cognitively challenging, involves a 
synthesis of information from multiple sources at multiple levels, 
or in some other way exhibits the abstraction and emergent 
properties of an "intelligent system."  

                          FACILITIES
The conference will be held at
   Lister Hill Center 
   National Library of Medicine
    Rockville Pike
   NIH, Building A
   Bethesda MD 
Seating in the conference center is strictly limited, so 
registrations will be accepted on a first-come, first-serve basis. 
Accomodations, as well as a reception and poster session, will be 
at the
   Bethesda Ramada Hotel 
    Wisconsin Avenue
   Bethesda MD 
A special room rate has been negotiated with the hotel, of $/day 
(expires /).  Attendees must make their own reservations, by 
writing the hotel or calling ()- and mentioning the 
ISMB conference.  To participate in a roommate-matching service, 
e-mail opitz@cs.wisc.edu.

                         TRANSPORTATION
The two facilities are within easy walking distance, convenient to 
the subway (Metro Red Line, Medical Center stop), and from there 
to the Amtrak station.  Nearby airports include Dulles, National, 
and Baltimore-Washington International. 

                           PROCEEDINGS
Full-length papers from both talks and posters will be published in
archival proceedings.  The citation is:

  Conference on Intelligent Systems for 
  Molecular Biology (eds. L. Hunter, 
  D. Searls, and J. Shavlik) AAAI/MIT
  Press, Menlo Park CA, .

                      TUTORIAL PROGRAM
Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on 
Tuesday, July .

:-:pm "Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer 
 Scientists"  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)

This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is 
intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists 
who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.  
Material covered will include structural and informational 
molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic 
material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected 
other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as 
relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has 
appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and 
has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition 
to his current work in computational biology.

:-:pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for 
 Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)

An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be 
presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological 
applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming 
languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as 
selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge 
representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended 
audience includes biologists with some computational background, 
but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. 
Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has 
worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to 
biological problems in both academia and industry.

:-:pm "Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory 
 in Biological Sequence Analysis" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos 
 National Laboratory) 

This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of 
intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine 
learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely 
interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical 
neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general 
characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such 
approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic 
views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical 
Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such 
techniques in this domain.

:-:pm "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming" 
 Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)

The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly 
non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally 
inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both 
the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and 
characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an 
extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size 
and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will 
also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to 
biological applications, and to identifying resources and software 
that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, 
a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught 
this subject since  and is the author of a standard text in 
the field.

:-:pm "Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis" 
 Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) 
 & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)

Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies 
are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of 
tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic 
pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of 
genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the 
identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes 
in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and 
functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty 
appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, 
represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order 
syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski 
has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area 
of word-based analyses.
