Indeed. I spend about % of my time dealing with quality stuff. It
is a hot number. 
Two journals worth looking at are:-
Quality Review Bulletin. Pub:Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations, one Renaissance boulevard, Oakbrook
Terrace, IL 
Quality in Health Care. BMJ Publishing Group, Box No. B,
Kennebunkport, ME
