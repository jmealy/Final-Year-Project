I would like to continue to thank everyone who has sent in a donation for the 
Mednews OCR/Scanner Fund.  We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard
Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.

Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:

John Sorenson
Carol Sigelman
Carla Moore
Barbara Moose
Judith Schrier

Again, thank you to all who gave!

I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to 
review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  
It runs under Windows . and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett 
Packard Scanners.  

When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; 
() text / graphics () input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file () 
automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. 

I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which 
parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.

Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The 
software gives you two "errors" at this point.  Blue which are words that were 
converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  
Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted 
correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more 
credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, 
you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal 
dictionary will only handle about  words.  I find this to be very limited, 
considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. 

After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word 
processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a 
seperate TIFF or PCX file format.

I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use

an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  
While most of my faxes were received in "standard" mode (x dpi), the 
accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. 

Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the 
limitations of the size of the user dictionary.   specialized words is just 
too small. 

If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

                                 Introduction

     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would 
soon be eliminated as a public health problem (), infectious diseases remain 
the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in 
the United States. Since the early s, the U.S. public health system has 
been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., 
Escherichia coli O:H, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, 
Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences 
of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, 
malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, 
control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug 
resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, 
salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (). Emerging 
infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those 
in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and 
minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of 
emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more 
effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs 
(). 
     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, "Emerging Infectious 
Diseases." Future articles will address these diseases, as well as 
surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and 
public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation 
of an outbreak of E. coli O:H in the western United States ().

            Update: Multistate Outbreak of Escherichia coli O:H
             Infections from Hamburgers -- Western United States,
                                   -
            =======================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR ()   DATE: Apr , 

     From November , , through February , , more than  
laboratory-confirmed infections with E. coli O:H and four associated 
deaths occurred in four states -- Washington, Idaho, California, and Nevada. 
This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation () that 
identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from 
one restaurant chain. Washington 
     On January , , a physician reported to the Washington Department of 
Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an 
increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January -, a 
case-control study comparing  of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or 
postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls 
implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset 
(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=.). On January 
, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants 
was initiated. 
     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-
February ,  patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the 
state health department. A total of  persons had illnesses meeting the case 
definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O:H infection or postdiarrheal HUS 
(Figure ). Of the  persons,  (%) had close contact with a person with 
confirmed E. coli O:H infection during the week preceding onset of 
symptoms. Of the remaining  persons,  (%) reported eating in a chain A 
restaurant during the  days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the  patients 
who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant,  (%) reported eating 
a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January  
through January . Of the  casepatients,  (%) were hospitalized;  
developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was . years 
(range: - years). Idaho 
     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified  persons with culture-
confirmed E. coli O:H infection, with illness onset dates from December 
, , through February ,  (Figure A). Four persons were 
hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset,  
(%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California 
     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was 
notified of a child with E. coli O:H infection who subsequently died. 
Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with 
E. coli O:H infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January . 
Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page

four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was 
reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall % 
increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December  and January 
 compared with the same period  year earlier. A case was defined as 
postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, 
or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O:H, with 
onset from November , , through January , . 
     Illnesses of  patients met the case definition (Figure B). The 
outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen 
persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median 
age of case-patients was  years (range: - years). A case-control study of 
the first  case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community 
controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched 
OR=; % confidence interval CI=.-). A study comparing case-patients 
who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-
sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=.). 
Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada 
     On January , after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten 
at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District 
issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea 
contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody 
diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness 
with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O:H, with 
onset from December , , through February , . Because local 
laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools 
for E. coli O:H, this organism was not identified in any patient. After 
SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of 
one patient  days after illness onset. 
     Of  persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure C), nine 
were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was . years (range: 
- years). Analysis of the first  patients identified and age- and sex-
matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during 
the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence 
limit=.). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients 
also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=.; % CI=.-
.). Other Investigation Findings 
     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases 
primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November 
, ; some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced on 
November , . The outbreak strain of E. coli O:H was isolated from  
lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed 
to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately , 
(%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. 
     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the 
United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page

contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing 
the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter 
plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one 
slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. 
     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in 
families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O:H is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first 
identified as a cause of illness in  during an outbreak of severe bloody 
diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (). This pathogen has since 
emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common 
cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked 
most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other 
food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been 
implicated (). Preliminary data from a CDC -year, nationwide, multicenter 
study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O:H 
that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of  
participating hospitals and was isolated from .% of all bloody stools, a 
higher rate than for any other pathogen. 
     Infection with E. coli O:H often is not recognized because most 
clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  
Volume  , Number                                            April , 

SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses 
associated with infection (). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea 
(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups 
and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and 
complications. Illness usually resolves after - days, but %-% of patients 
develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
renal failure, and a death rate of %-%. 
     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community 
outbreaks of E. coli O:H in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite 
the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in 
three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington 
(). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from 
persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O:H using SMAC agar (). 
When infections with E. coli O:H are identified, they should be reported 
to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public 
health action to prevent further cases. 
     E. coli O:H lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can 
contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify 
critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce 
the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O:H entering the meat supply. 
Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with 
pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens 
from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be 
internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook 
ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices 
are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played 
an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim 
recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 
 F (. C) (FDA, personal communication, ). 
     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report 
and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be 
consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of 
outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of 
this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections 
caused by E. coli O:H and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. 
coli O:H.

            Use of Smokeless Tobacco Among Adults -- United States,
                                     
            =======================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR ()   DATE: Apr , 

     Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the 
United States almost tripled from  through  (). Long-term use of 
smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of 
oral cancer () -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who 
currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (). 
To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, 
CDC's  National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease 
Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing 
tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, 
noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to  years. This 
report summarizes findings from this survey. 
     The  NHIS-HPDP supplement asked "Have you used snuff at least  
times in your entire life?" and "Do you use snuff now?" Similar questions were 
asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of 
smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco 
use at least  times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the 
time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having 
used snuff or chewing tobacco at least  times and not using either at the 
time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and 
former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at 
least  cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as 
those who reported having smoked at least  cigarettes and who were not 
smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on 
smokeless tobacco use were available for , persons aged greater than or 
equal to  years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide 
national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using 
standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) 
(). 
     In , an estimated . million (.%) U.S. adults were current users 
of smokeless tobacco, including . million (.%) men and , (.%) 
women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco 
use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was 
highest among those aged - years (Table ); for women, the prevalence was 
highest among those aged greater than or equal to  years. The prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan 
Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American 
Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was 
substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in 
rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page

men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only 
for women (p less than .) (Table ). 
     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those 
aged - years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of 
chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table ). Although 
women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest 
among those aged greater than or equal to  years. 
     An estimated . million (.% % CI=.-.) adults reported being 
former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were 
former smokeless tobacco users was .% (% CI=.-.). Among persons 
aged - years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users 
(.% % CI=.-.) than among chewing tobacco users (.% % 
CI=.-.). Among persons aged - years, the proportion of former users 
was similar for snuff (.% % CI=.-.) and chewing tobacco (.% 
% CI=.-.). 
     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, .% (% CI=.-.) 
currently smoked, .% (% CI=.-.) formerly smoked, and .% (% 
CI=.-.) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, .% (% 
CI=.-.) were current users of smokeless tobacco. 
     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (.% 
% CI=.-.) than among chewing tobacco users (.% % CI=.-
.).

Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless 
tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in 
particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that 
link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral 
snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this 
behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for 
nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (). 
     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among 
racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels 
and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require 
further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role 
in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the 
differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (,). 
     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current 
smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the  NHIS-HPDP, the 
prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco 
users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous 
study among college students, % of current smokeless tobacco users smoked

occasionally (). In addition, approximately % of adults who formerly smoked 
reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to 
stop smoking (). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health 
implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. 
     The national health objectives for the year  have established special 
population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless 
tobacco use, including males aged - years (to no more than % by the year 
 objective .) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more 
than % by the year  objective .a) (). Strategies to lower the 
prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless 
tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, 
enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes 
commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to 
routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based 
prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit 
tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events ().
