	I had asked everyone about problems installing a  meg
simm and an  meg simm in my Centris , but the folks at the
local Apple store called the folks in Cupertino and found that
you can't have simms of different speeds in one machine, even
if they are both fast enough - ie - My  ns  meg and ns 
meg simms were incompatibable...  Just thought people might
want to know.....
