When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run
Speedometer. on some of the new Macs.  Both machines were running
System., had a " RGB.  Don't know what the caches were set to.
Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris is quite a
bit faster than the LC III:

		Centris		LCIII

CPU		.			.
Graf		.			.
Disk		.			.
Math		.			.

P.R. Rating	.			.

So, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed
difference between these two machines according to Speedometer..
