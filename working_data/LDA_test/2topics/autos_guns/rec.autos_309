I have been for a fairly hard run in an MX, what they lack in power they
surely make up for in handling.  Great for back streets with heaps of corners.
They are a fairly light car with a low center of gravity and a quite free
revving DOHC engine, a fun car.  Have you driven a TURBO converted
MX?  Now they are starting to perform!  I've often thought a Mazda rotary
would go well in the XM too....anyone done it?

Regards Scott.
