We're considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with WD and we have the
following questions (All we would do is go skiing -- no off-roading):

. With WD, do we need the "performance axle" - (limited slip axle).
Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tires
are on different terrain. 

. Do we need the all-terrain tires (P/X) or will the
all-season (P/X) be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe?


Thanks,


Tom
