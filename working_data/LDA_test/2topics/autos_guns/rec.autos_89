A "fuel injector cleaning" at the dealer is probably little more than
them opening your gas tank, dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner,
and sending you on your merry way $ poorer.  Go to KMart and buy the
cleaner yourself for $..
 
Just because you dealer sez you need it, don't mean it's necessarily so.
Be suspicious.
