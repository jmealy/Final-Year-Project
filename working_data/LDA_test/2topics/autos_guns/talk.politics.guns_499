If I recall correctly, the bill would provide for concealed carry if
the person takes a -hr DPS safety course in firearms and pays a $
fee for the license.  The bill is apparently veto-proof in the House,
but LtGov Bullock has said it will never come to the floor of the
Senate and Dreamboat Annie has vowed to veto it if it comes to her
desk.  *shrug*
