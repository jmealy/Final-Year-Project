Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at + mph,
nor do they reach . However, using `high' to be - mph:

a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several
k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip
I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving -
miles a day at typically - mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  
would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.
No problems with winds and curves. 

Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where
we were doing + all the way to Houston. No problems.

b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see
no difference between sustained  mph and sustained mph. On the trip
back from New Orleans, we got about  mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind
you, the engine revs to almost k at . The civic is markedly better
than the Integra in fuel economy. k miles down the road, I still
get  mpg at - mph driving.



Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough
bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have -k miles on them and advertise 
rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for k, I'd darn well
expect the sucker to last k miles.


Ever got caught behind a early 's SDL at a stop light? It's not
pleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos
and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.

As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap! I personally wouldn't
buy a diesel car for any reason - what does it buy me?
