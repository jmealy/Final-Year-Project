	Exterior in good condition

	Pioneer DX  car stereo.
		- CD player
		-  FM presets,  AM
		- removable faceplate
		- seperate component speakers professionally mounted
		  in the doors.

The car has been well maintained.  I wax it often and keep the interior
clean.  Its a good running car with a solid body (no rust thru, tiny
spots of surface rust.  When I see a spot I touch it up.)  The stereo
makes the car.  I have had no mechanical problems with it.

I'm looking for $. firm.  The car has an average wholesale value of 
about $. without the stereo.  The stereo cost me $. last July.
