In fact, they make some ,but they just don't sell them here in U.S.

Sunny California is a .l wagon based on Sentra.
Avenil is a .l WD/WD wagon .(It looks like Infinity G 
but actually it's independently designed to be a wagon.I mean, it's 
not based on any sedans.) 
 
Nissan had better consider to sell them here.
