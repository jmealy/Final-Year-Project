As you can see, I have two  cars, both worth about $ each.
The problem is that maintenance costs on these two cars is
running about $ per year and insurance $ per year.

What am I doing wrong?

Within the last two months, the follows costs have occured:

Dodge  SE (Dodge's attempt at the American German car!)

$, - replace head gasket
$   - new radiator

Chevy Nova CL (Chevy's attempt at a Japan import!)

$ - tune-up,oil change,valve gasket,middle exhaust pipe, misc.

Note also that the Chevy Nova CL () has only  horsepwer!
Does anyone out there have a Chevy Nova with enough power
to get up even a small hill without knocking? Is there
something wrong with my car, I even use  octane gas!
(I have consider going to  octane if I can find it!)

Anyway, what are the best maintenance items to do-it-yourself,
and what equipment is needed?
