Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies
of the National Crime Survey (-) in an effort to examine what
it said about self-defense with a firearm.

      I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple
of things jumped out at me.  First only  and  specify the type of
weapon used in self defense.  , , and  refer only to "weapon."
The second is that while assaults rose about % from  to , w/gun
defenses reported *fell* by almost %.  Unless there's an explanation for
this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going 
ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.

      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and
not just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to have
changed significantly between  and .
