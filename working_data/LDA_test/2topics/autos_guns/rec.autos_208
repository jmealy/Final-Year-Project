I recently posted an article asking what kind of rates single, male
drivers under  yrs old were paying on performance cars. Here's a summary of
the replies I received.
 
 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I'm not under  anymore (but is  close enough).
 
 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (hp model).
No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving ,
airbag, abs, security alarm, single.
 
$/year  $ decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $
for the $,, umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base
policy is the standard $, - $, - $, policy required in DE.
 
After nd defensive driving course it will be % less.
 
I bought the car in September .  The company I was with (never had
and accident or ticket in  years) quoted me $,.
 
Hope this helps.

    Kevin:
 
    (Hope I remembered your name correctly)...
 
    You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year
    I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the
    same inquiry as you.
 
    Age:  (then and now)
    Car:  Eagle Talon TSi AWD
    Driving Record: Clean
    State: Illinois
    Cost: $/ mos.
 
    I turn  in May and the insurance goes down to $/ mos.
    Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.
 
    I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more
    than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe I'm just lucky.
 
    Hope the info helps.

I'm ; live in Norman, Oklahoma; drive an ' Thunderbird SC; have
never made a claim against my insurance (though I have been hit
several times by negligent drivers who couldn't see stop signs or
were fiddling with their radios); and I have had three moving violations
in the last  months (one for going  in a ; one for "failure to
clear an intersection" (I still say the damn light was yellow); and
one for going  in a  (which didn't go on my record)). My rates
from State Farm (with a passive restraint deduction) on liability,
$ deductible comprehensive, and $ deductible collision are
roughly $/year. (I was paying just over $/year for a ' Escort LX.)

I am beyond the "under " age group, but I have an experience a few
years ago that might be interesting to you.  I owned a  Toyota Celica
GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners
included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche  ( model years).
I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling
(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less
money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury
car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the .
I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the , but i
decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked
about what would happen to my rate with either car.
 
"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as
the Celica (the ' Celica was considered a subcompact and for that
year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because
the car will be  years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue
to handle your account.
 
"If you buy the Porsche , we'll have to change you to the standard
[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with
a , it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,
but cancel you after that."
 
"But the Supra is much faster than the , and the  is actually
faster than the [standard] .  That doens't make sense."
 
 That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For
some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -
as very traditional and conservative."
 
I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche
dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure
guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken
a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I
concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto
theft.

I live in Idaho.  When I was < many years ago ( years) I bought a Trans
Am (new).  Insurance was about $/year.  When I turned , it immediately
dropped to $/year.  I had not had any accidents before or after, this was
strictly an age change.  That same rate stayed pretty much the same until I
sold the car  years ago.  My F- pickup is about $/year less.
 
The real amazing thing is that when I woke up at age , I felt SO MUCH MORE
RESPONSIBLE than I was before...  :-)

Let's see, I'm , single, male, clean driving record. I have a  VW COrrado

good deal if you ask me.
 
I was thinking about getting a Talon, but I think the insurance is higher
for a "turbo" sports car vs a V

Mass,
 
	One thing that makes a HUGE difference in MASS is the town you live in.
I'm personally in one of the best towns within reasonable distance
of Boston.  If I moved to the absolute best it would go down to about
$, if I moved to the worst it would be $+..
 
	Also one accident and a couple of tickets, would probably add another $...

I have a  Mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd, am  years old and have no
tickets that went on my record.  I live in Illinois just outside of Chicago
and pay $ a year with full coverage at State Farm.  I did get a small
discount because of my alarm system($ a year).  I only live  miles from
Chicago but if I actually lived in the city the price would be about $
a year.
======================================================================== 
I'm over , but in case you're interested anyway, I'm insuring a  SHO
for $/ month.  Thats k personal+k total+k property with
 deductible, glass and towing, State Farm.

Unless you are under  or have been driving for less than 
years, I think you are being seriously ripped off.  I don't have
one of the performance cars you listed, but if your record is
clean, then you should not be paying over $K.
 
Did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find?
Although rates are supposed to be standardized, I've found that
most places I initially call, give me some ridiculously high
quote and *finaly*, I hit one that is much lower.
 
Also, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at
renewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a low
rate.  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance
companies ^).
