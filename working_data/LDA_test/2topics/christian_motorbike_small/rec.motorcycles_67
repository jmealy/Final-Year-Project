Interesting.  I'd fight the ticket.  First off, there's a / chance
the cop won't show up.  Secondly, if he does show up, you should point
out that he lied (purgered) on the ticket.  Why +?  I beleive that if
yo're charged with going more than mph that the posted speed it's a
more severe ticket.  You couldn't have p[ossibly been going +, right?!
