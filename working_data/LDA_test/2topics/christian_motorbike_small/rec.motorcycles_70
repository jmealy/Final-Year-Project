  It depreciates much faster, too.

The ' GLA hit the traps at . according to Cycle magazine. Yeah,
they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then
they bottom out. Got my ' GLI w/  miles on the odometer for
just under $K in May of  and would ask for $ now with almost
K miles onnit....that's about % of what a new GLI would cost.

Think the ' GLI originally sold for $ brand new, not sure. 
If that's the case then it depreciated .% over  years or a mere
$. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to
depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of
the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about
Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the
knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-) 

According to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is a
real dog when he pillions his lb wife. All that money for a dog that
doesn't defecate much. =:-]
