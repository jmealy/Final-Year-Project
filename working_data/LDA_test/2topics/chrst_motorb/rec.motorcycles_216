Not too hard to remember, I bought a GS new in '. :-) It was
rd place in the ' speed wars (behind the CBX & XS Eleven) with a
. @  / mile, and  horses. That wouldn't even make a good 
these days. Then again, I paid $ for it, so technology isn't the
only thing that's changed. Of course I'd still rather ride the old GS
across three states than any of the 's.

I guess it's an indication of how much things have changed that a 
second  didn't seem too far out of line.
