I'm looking for a - Kawasaki ZX- engine.  Just the engine,
no intake, exhaust, ignition, etc.  Preferably in the central texas
area, but we haven't had much luck around here so we'll take whatever we
can get.  Please reply via mail or call () - if you have one
(or more...  really need a spare).

Thanx
