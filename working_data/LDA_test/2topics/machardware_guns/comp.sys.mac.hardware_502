The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:

I have a ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the
equivalent of a Plus (System  and MacEnvy both identify it as such).

The MacRescue board clips onto the  on the MB.  It also has
a  itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an
entirely easy thing to do) and clean the "legs" of the .
Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with
snap on upgrades:  the 's "legs" will oxidize, causing 
unusual system errors.

Well, that's me.

So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be
fairly easy to put a socket in where the  currently is, and
modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not % sure of
is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two s aren't
acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on
the performance of my Mac.  I'm about % sure.

Will someone provide the extra %?
