I have a Radius Precision Color x video card for the Mac that fits in a 
NuBus slot.  The card has  Mb of VRAM on it, which means that -bit color 
is possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan
rate you can think of (I used it at x, x and x, but it
can go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a
software control panel.

  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw 
calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing
up the mac processor for other tasks. 

  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night
was $ at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $ + shipping.  It is just
over a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the
original manuals.

  Hurry!
