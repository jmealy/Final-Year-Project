Ok I want to get a color Mac I don't care if it is an LC or a Mac II or
what but I want to go to a color machine.  I'd prefer to trade my
present Mac SE system plus some cash or other equipment for the color
system as right now I'm not full of the $$$ to buy a color system
outright.
Here's what my Mac SE system has...

Mac SE / with internal K drive
 Meg external
External K drive
ImageWriter II with  color ribbon

Stuff that can go with it......
I've got  modems and I'd be willing to give  of the 's and the
 with the system

MultiTech Multimodem II ( data/fax)
U.S. Robotics Sportster ( data)
Microcom QX/K         (normally will connect at only  as highest
but it will do faster if connected to another Microcom)

The USR and the MultiTech are both brand-new
