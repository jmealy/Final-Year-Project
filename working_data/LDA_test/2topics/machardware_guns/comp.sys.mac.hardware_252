The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset
of the 's functions.  If you look underneath your front left floppy
bay you will find three chips, all approximately the same size.  One will
be the , the next the , and the third, approximately the same
size, will be the Apple chip.  It is easy to spot because it has a 'hump'
in the middle of it.


Example:


                         -----------
                        /           \
         ---------------             ---------------
         |                                         |
         |                                         |

That and the Apple logo should make it easy to find.
