I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:

Model: Centris  with  MB/ HD,  VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MXF with " monitor adaptor (for resolution of *)

I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.

My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?
