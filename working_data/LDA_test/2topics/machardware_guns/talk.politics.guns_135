Any NRA headquarters weenies listening to this man. Any RTKBA organization
honcho listening. It's time to stop fighting the Brady's and the Schumer's
(now there's an interesting meaning to the acronynm BS) from the comfort
of the office....we had better get serious with our time and money and get
after it or we might just as well pack it in now.
