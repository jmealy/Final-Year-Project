I have a Lightening Scan Pro  hand scanner.  It came with scanning/editing
software, OCR software, and some plug-in modules for Photoshop et al.  The
scanner was a tad on the pricey side ($), but the scans are incredibly
accurate, in  level,  dpi grayscale.  It also has dithered and line art
settings when grayscale isn't desired.  Great scanning software, easy to use.  I
frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image
in the note.  Hope this helps!
