Hi there!

I wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display
card for driving a " multisync (NEC D)?
The NEC D can do horizontal refresh from . kHz to  kHz and
vertical from  Hz to  Hz and can do max x interlaced,
though I am looking for something more like x or x
noninterlaced.
It would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite
freely within these limits and is capable to display at least
bits/pixel, preferably more.

Is there anything on the market that comes even close?


Thanks
