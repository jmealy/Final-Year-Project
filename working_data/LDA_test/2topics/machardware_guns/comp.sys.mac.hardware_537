The Logitech ScanMan  is a nice unit, compact and effective it will
bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. Note that its effective
resolution in grey scale mode is only about  dpi. If you don't intend
to magnify a graphic, it works fine. A true  level gray scanner would
work better for images.
