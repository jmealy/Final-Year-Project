I have finally decided to update my SE :-)).
I am planning on buying a Centris -/ CD.
Now, what monitor should I get? Here are a few
guidelines:
	My wife uses PageMaker occasionally, I use Excel sometimes
	and I do alot of Telecommuting from home to work. We both
	do Word processing. Greater than  inches.

I have looked at the Radius Color Pivot. This can be bought for
under $. I have heard good things about the E-Machines T-,
the older model not the new T- II. How about the Super Mac T?
These both can be had for a little over $. Any others??
