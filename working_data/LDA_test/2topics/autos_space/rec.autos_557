Dumbest options? Well here in the UK, BMW offer a 'no-smokers' option...
It just means they take the fag lighter out.... big deal....

BTW - I just bought a Honda CRX F..... its neat... did consider an MR targa,
MX (you guys call it Miata?).... but that CRX just one my heart with that 
body kit and -spokes....
