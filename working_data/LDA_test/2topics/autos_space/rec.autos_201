I'm plannig to trade my Sentra SE-R in with a NX.  My car has ,
miles on it and is a ' model.  The NX the dealer is selling is a '
model with ,miles on it.  It has a T-Bar Roof, a/c, and an airbag,
which my Sentra does not have.  They are asking for $.  Is that a fair
deal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX is that the engine did not
seem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical
engine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine
to it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX's
engine is a little "tight."  So, if I buy the NX and "excercise" it
well, should that slight power problem go away?  Any advice on this will be
much appreciated.  Thanks.  Please reply via e-mail if possible.
