hmmmm.. not sure, since no such beast exists.. i can tell you another
though..  you won't catch me dead in a GMC Syclone or Typhoon either,
 bhp or not.. not even the fact that Clint Eastwood has one.  just
my taste,  no rational reasons for it.


CAR just tested the S wagon with  banger and  speed manual.  Rave
review except for Servotronic..  Audi is trying to recoup the
development costs for the V, and since the V is not selling well,
they are sticking it into the  series cars.. Neat marketing trick,
eh?  yeah, a  V-v wouldn't be a bad idea as competition for the
upcoming bimmer /i would it?  maybe they can use a . liter
version to avoid conflicts with the v model.. then strip off all the
luxo-garbage.  let the S remain with the flared arches and fat tires
to go fight with the M.... maybe turn up the boost a wee bit to bump
bhp up to say  or so.. :-) while keeping the  V with mercedes
E style subtlety.

blah blah blah....
