Makes sense, since the new Mercedes Benz engines go from .L- to a .L-.
Nothing in between.  BTW, I beleive the numbers on those MB engines are
 and  hp respectively.  The one-upmanship in hp might induce BMW
to create a larger six.  Also, the . E has lagged behind the -er
. for some time wrt hp.   I am sure the Bavarians wouldn't want to be
"shown-up" by the Schwabians.

PS- those MB engines haven't been released over here yet.
