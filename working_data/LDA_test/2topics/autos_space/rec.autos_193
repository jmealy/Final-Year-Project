I have a  Acura Integra  speed with , miles on it. It is positively
the worst car I have ever owned. I had an  Prelude that had k miles on
it when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religious
attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in
exactly the same manner..

  . It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)
  .  sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)
  . All struts started leaking about -k miles
  . Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)
  . Seek stop working on radio about k miles
  . Two timing belts.
  . Constant error signals from computer.

  . And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No.  piston seriously damaging
     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done
     last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because
     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 
     weeks to get because it is on national back order. 

     Everything on the engine is unique to the  year. They went to a new
     design in . Parts are very expensive.
