I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity.  For a target  km above the surface of Earth,
you need a delta-v of . km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of  seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry
weight of  kg would require only about  kg of fuel+oxidizer.
A small dispersal charge embedded in about  kg of sand or
birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be
the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within
the capability of the amateur rocketry community.

It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction
of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.
Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed
here: $ billion for the first person to spend  year
on the moon, $ million for the first erradication of
an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $
for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure
there are at least  other astronomers, nature lovers,
or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.

Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.
(Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use
of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied
to Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)
