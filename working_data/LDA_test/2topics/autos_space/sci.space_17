    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS

    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on
    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.

		     (/.)
    D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km
	 g  p  f  n

	       (/)
    S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than
     g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = . m/s^ and g	is the surface
					    e		      t
			      gravity of the target body. This scaling is
			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for
			      other bodies.

		(/.)
    S = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  ,
     p	  a   t							    t
			      p  = . g/cm^ for alluvium at the Jangle U
			       a
			      crater site, p = . g/cm^ for average
			      rock on the continental shields.

    C			    : crater collapse factor,  for craters <=  km
			      in diameter, . for larger craters (on Earth).

							    (/.)
    K			    : . km / (kT TNT equivalent)
     n			      empirically determined from the Jangle U
			      nuclear test crater.

	      		   		       
    W = pi * d	* delta * V  / ( * . *   )
			    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent
			      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile
			      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 
			      g/cm^ is fairly good for an asteroid.

    An RMS velocity of V =  km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing
    asteroids.

    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor
    Crater in Arizona (. km diameter) would have been about  meters in
    diameter.

    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, ):

    Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy
    diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* *^ ergs)

     			    		     ^-		^
      			  		     ^-		^
      .	        		     ^-		^

    assuming simple scaling laws. Note that *^ ergs =   tons TNT
    equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.

    MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY

    Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the "Encyclopaedia
    Brittanica", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing
    in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, ). The latter was written with
    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind
    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).

    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John
    Snyder's USGS publication "Map Projections--A Working Manual", USGS
    Professional Paper . This contains detailed descriptions of 
    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both
    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a
    neat book, all  pages worth. This one's $.

    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,
    "An Album of Map Projections", USGS Professional Paper . This
    contains less detail on about  projections and variants. Formulas are
    in the back, example plots in the front. $,  pages.

    You can order these  ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:
    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey,  National
    Center, Reston, VA . ()-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and
    tell you where to send your money. Expect a - week turnaround time.

    A much faster way (about  week) is through Timely Discount Topos,
    ()--,  W. th Drive, Suite , Broomfield, CO . Call
    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a
    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up
    for you. Add about a $- service charge, plus shipping.

    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:

	R. Miller and F. Reddy, "Mapping the World in Pascal",
	Byte V #, December 

	Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A
	demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (, point) coastline data
	is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.

    INTERPRETING THE FITS IMAGE FORMAT

    If you just need to examine FITS images, use the ppm package (see the
    comp.graphics FAQ) to convert them to your preferred format. For more
    information on the format and other software to read and write it, see
    the sci.astro.fits FAQ.


    SKY (UNIX EPHEMERIS PROGRAM)

    The th Edition of the Unix operating system came with several software
    systems not distributed because of older media capacity limitations.
    Included were an ephmeris, a satellite track, and speech synthesis
    software. The ephmeris, sky(), is available within AT&T and to sites
    possessing a Unix source code license. The program is regarded as Unix
    source code. Sky is <.MB. Send proof of source code license to

    THREE-DIMENSIONAL STAR/GALAXY COORDINATES

    To generate D coordinates of astronomical objects, first obtain an
    astronomical database which specifies right ascension, declination, and
    parallax for the objects. Convert parallax into distance using the
    formula in part  of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates
    on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and
    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and
    scale this by the distance.

    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog
    (sources listed in FAQ section ) or "The Catalogue of Stars within 
    parsecs of the Sun" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on
    ames.arc.nasa.gov).
