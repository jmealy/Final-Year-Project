I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really
hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
hand both come crashing into my face.  After coming to, which is
about  minutes later, I change my clothes (because by this time
all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck
down about  Tylenol to ease the pain.  Later in the day I then
proceed with refilling the engine oil.

It's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one
weekend---I go through about  bottles of Tylenol and  bags of ice.
