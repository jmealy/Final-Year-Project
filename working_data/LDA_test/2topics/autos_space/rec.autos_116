a couple of things:  blowing a hose doesn't speak of engine reliability, and 
while it is true that quad's have a problem with head gasket leaks, that was
a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected.  also i know pontiac is
replacing head gaskets that leak for free for year/k miles.  other than
that i have found my quad to be completely solid and the direct ignition 
system means no wires/rotor/rotor-cap to ever deal with.  also hydrolic lifters
mean no valve adjustments ever.  i'm not badmouthing the integra engine, i just
think you are going overboard on slamming the quad.  you are quite correct
that the integra engine is quieter, although i would not say smoother, my
quad loves to rev, especially at the high-end.  do you have any evidence
of blocks cracking on quads?  i have not heard of this.
