From article <Apr..@ucsu.Colorado.EDU>, by lorenzo@rintintin.Colorado.EDU (Eric Lorenzo):

--Let me put it like this.  The only similarity between the three models
  is the "", or -liter engine displacement.  Actually, the SC (the
  coupe) and the GS (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same .
  liter inline-six, and the ES (popular small sedan) uses . V shared
  with the Camry.  The SC is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS is the new
  luxury sedan, and the ES is the base executive sedan.  All three look
  completely different.
