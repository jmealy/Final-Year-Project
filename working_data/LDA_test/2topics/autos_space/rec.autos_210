Alright GM!!!! Finally my wishes have come true, Moby Dick with a Corvette
engine.  DOn't you think they should maybe spend the money doing something
about the lousy build/quality/design of their bigger selling cars?  This is
another example of why GM is in so much trouble.  If you're going to stick
the LT- or ZR- engine in a car, at least make it a nice looking one.
Sheesh
