I have a small program to extract a x image from a vga  color screen,
and store that image in a TIFF file.  I need to insert the image into a
sales brochure, which I then need printed in  color.  On a mac, I would
use Photoshop to separate the image into  EPS files, and then pull it into
quark express, then get it printed to film on a lintronix at a service bureau.

However, I don't have a mac, but I do have windows.  What would I need to 
do this type of operation in the windows . environment?  Are there any
separation programs available on the net?  Is there a good page layout program
that I should look into?

Thanks in advance.
