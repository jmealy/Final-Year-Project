Does ANYONE out there in Net-land have any information on the Cobra . 
card?  The sticker on the end of the card reads
        Model: Cobra -B-
        Bios:  Cobra v.

I Havn't been able to find anything about it from anyone!  If you have 
any information on how to get a hold of the company which produces the 
card or know where any drivers are for it, PLEASE let me know!

As far as I can tell, it's a CGA card that is taking up  of my -bit 
ISA slots but when I enable the test patterns, it displays much more than 
the usualy  CGA colors... At least  from what I can count.. Thanks!
