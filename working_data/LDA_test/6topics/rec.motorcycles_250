I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler "economy" tire, the ME. Good
for mid-size older bikes. Rated to mph. Wearing well and handles
my  mile ride(twisties) to work well on the SR. Costs a bit 
more than the Chengs/IRC's etc, but still less than the Sport
Metzlers for the newer bikes. Cost from Chaparral is about $ for the
front, and $ for the rear.
