long
disk


I don't know how many times I've posted this the net.  No one EVER
listens.  

Once and for all:  Floptical Media is only $. a megabyte if you don't
know where to buy it.  I am bying my flopticals at $ per  disks.  I
see that as $. a meagabyte, NOT $..  No, I'm not buying in bulk, I'm
not getting a special deal.  $. a meg is good in my book, Approching
floppy price.

Any questions on my source can be sent to ctr@po.cwru.edu.
