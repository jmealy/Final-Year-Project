                        MAGELLAN STATUS REPORT
                            April , 

.  The Magellan mission at Venus continues normally, gathering gravity
data which provides measurement of density variations in the upper
mantle which can be correlated to surface topography.  Spacecraft
performance is nominal.

.  Magellan has completed  orbits of Venus and is now  days from
the end of Cycle- and the start of the Transition Experiment.

.  No significant activities are expected next week, as preparations
for aerobraking continue on schedule.
