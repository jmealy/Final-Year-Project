Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to
this newsgroup.  The "test" was the following command:



I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on
various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and
workstations.  The results are posted below:

Funny how the IIsi running at  MHz is slower than other equivalent
machines, lots slower in fact.  Perhaps the version of Mathematica
makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated.
Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it.  Wow. 

Basically, though, I wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data.  It
seems that Mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables.  I
was just curious how different machines would measure up.  

Well, if you have any questions or if I forgot something, just drop me
a line at "cmmiller@iastate.edu".
