I've just read Carol's response and I just had to get into this.  I've
got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say
what they say.  They are  Peter :-,  Timothy :-, and
Galatians :-.  

Also, based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges
people if they follow him (see Acts :- and John :-) and that
those who reject Jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke
(see John :-), then Jesus' words are true and do not need
interpretation, nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word
if it had to be interpreted.
