As you point out, the experiments would be difficult. But we know
enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.
There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over
to begin a turn.

	. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.

	. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.

	. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a
	torque which twists the bike over.

Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of ,
, and  mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be
needed to produce (say)  degrees of lean in (say)  seconds by each
effect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds  is dominant, and at
high speeds  is dominant, and at all speeds  contributes not far off
bugger all, relatively speaking.

By the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to
run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running
group where we could start "counter-footing" arguments and have them
all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?
