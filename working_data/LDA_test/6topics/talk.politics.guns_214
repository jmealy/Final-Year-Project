Hmmm, the SJ Merc. carries Targemasters West, National Shooting club,
 Reeds sportshop, Sportsmens supply and Big  ads. They all sell guns.
No they don't have any adds like in Shotgun news.  If they won't at least
run the current adds I swear I'll cancel my subscription and end to cash
to the CRPA.
