I have the need for displaying  / D surfaces under X, using only
Xlib, Xt and Xm.  Does anyone know of a package, available on internet,
which will be able to do the work?

   I am looking for a STAND-ALONE package providing similar functions
to "xprism" available with Khoros, but without the numerous libraries
required for it.  I want to be able to recompile it and run it on
various platforms, from SGIs to is (UNIX).

   Any help will be appreciated.
