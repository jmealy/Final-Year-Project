Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM:

I put  K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra  (in the  slots closest to the
RAM SIMM slots) and I got no results whatsoever.  I have been told that
the built-in video should support at least bit and maybe bit color on
a Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel still
lists bit ( colors) as the highest possible.

Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?
Do you have to do something to activate them?
Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?

BTW, I am running System . with  Megs of RAM.
