-->Okay DoD'ers, here's a goddamn mystery for ya !

-->Today I was turning a  degree corner just like on any other day, but there

-->to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very

--Check the bottom of your pipes Barry -- suspect that is what may
--have hit.  I did the same a few years past & thought it was the
--peg but found the bottom of my pipe has made contact & showed a
--good sized dent & scratch.

-- Believe you'd feel the suddent change on your foot if the peg
--had bumped.  As for the piece missing -- contribute that to 
--vibration loss.

Yep, the same thing happened to me on my old Honda  Twinstar.
