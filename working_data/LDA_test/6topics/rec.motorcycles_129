 ADDITIONAL NOTES:: 
   This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.
   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one
   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so
   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.

   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.
   For folks who have been to previous 'er rallies at Mariposa, 
   Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.
   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.
   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. 
   Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early
   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays
   for camping Thursday through Monday ( days).  There will be a tour Friday
   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the
   awards ceremony.
