Help!  I'm trying to program my VGA!  I've got it working
with in pascal with the following routines for mode $h
(**).  I've got a VESA compatable Trident C w/meg
and need to program in * mode.  I don't care how many colors.
 
Could someone take this code and help me write  new procedures to
replace them so that it'll work in ** or **?
 
That'd be GREAT!  Thanks...
 
Here is the code I currently have for ** mode:
 
  Procedure GraphMode;
 
    Begin { VideoMode }
      Asm
        Mov  AH,
        Mov  AL,h
        Int  h
      End;
    End;  { VideoMode }
 
  Procedure PlotPoint (x, y, c : Integer);
 
    Begin
      Mem[$A:x+y*]:=c;
    End;
