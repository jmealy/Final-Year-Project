I have a Diamond Speedstar X board that I want to program
for  bit x graphics, or possibly x  bit color.
Does anybody have any libraries supporting these modes on this
board? Even somes simple routines to set the graphics mode and
plot individual pixels would be a great help. I plan to use the
routines with djgp.

   Thanks in advance. Please respond also via e-mail.
