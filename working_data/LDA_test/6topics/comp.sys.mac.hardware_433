I would like more info on this if anybody has it. Our Exabyte
 tapedrive has never been working from the Quadra .
We have been trying it since September , replaced cabling,
inits, I don't know what all. All the "industry experts" we
phoned (the tapedrive dealer, our Apple dealer, the software
dealer) all say it's our fault, or they don't know. The last
thing they said was that we needed a special Quadra SCSI terminator
(???). Anybody know more? Thanks,
