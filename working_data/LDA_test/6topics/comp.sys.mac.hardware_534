I recently upgraded to System . and now I also upgraded my
DeskWriter drivers from . to ..  I got the software from Sumex,
but it is not clear to me where to install what.

Can someone tell me which of the files that come with DW-. go where
and for what purpose?  What can be left out, for instance, if
you don't want to do background printing?

Thanks,

	Tom
