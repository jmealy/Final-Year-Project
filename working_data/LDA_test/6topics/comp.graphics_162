Off the top of my head, I might try:

Given: p_, p_, p_, p_

Find:  p_c (center of sphere determined by p_, ..., p_), 
       dist(p_c, p_i) (radius)

p_c is the same distance from our four points, so
dist(p_c,p_) = dist(p_c,p_) = dist(p_c,p_) = dist(p_c,p_) 

Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots:
distsq(p_c,p_) = distsq(p_c,p_) = distsq(p_c,p_) = distsq(p_c,p_) 

Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the 
x^_c, y^_c, and z^_c terms cancel out, leaving you with three 
linearly independent equations and three unknowns (x_c, y_c, z_c).  
Solve using your favorite method.  :)


All the best,
