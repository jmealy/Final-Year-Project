But the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips
you can get - an Alpha is WAY slow at  MHz, but blazes at
 MHz.



But the  is (or will soon be) available in  MHz version,
making it "comparable" to a DX-


I think you have that one turned around; they have faster clock
cycles but less power behind each cycle. Not to mention that the
Intel instruction stream is BYTE-oriented (longest Intel instruction
is  bytes; what an odd number :-) which makes it hard to do any
intelligent memory subsystem.
