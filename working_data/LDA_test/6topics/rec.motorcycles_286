Step ) After you become a member, they will ship your bike, UNCRATED to 
just about anywhere across the fruited plain for a few hundred bucks.

I have used this service and have been continually pleased.  They usually
only take a few days for the whole thing, and you do not have to prepare
the bike in any way (other than draining the gas).  Not to mention that
it is about % of the normal shipping costs (by the time you crate a bike
and ship it with another company, you can pay around $)
