The best program I've seen for viewing such files is VPIC.  You'll want version . or later.  (.x is current.)  It allows you to view in  and  bit modes.  It really is QUITE nice.

Now, for a return question:  Do you run Windows?  If so, what are the dates on your drivers?  The newest ones *I* can find are from around -??-!!  My problem is they conflict with Star Trek: After Dark, and other things as well.  I'm willing to bet that it's the drivers, and NOT the programs.  Anyone out there have info on newer SS (NOT X) drivers for windows or OS/?
