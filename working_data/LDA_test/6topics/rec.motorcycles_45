To go one step further, you could write Roland Slabon, Pres. of the
Vintage BMW Motorcycle Owners Ltd at P.O. box , Exeter, New Hampshire 
 and he'll send you copy of the bimonthly rag with info as to where
to send your $ bucks if ya want to join. As far as the price of ''s
Beemers, it varies wildly, from a low of around $ for an unrestored
bike that still runs (like an R or R) to $ or so for a restored
RS.  Don't listen to that bull about the old bmw's not being "good 
enough" to ride in todays world.. Hell, I'm riding my  R Single
from Mississippi to the BMW MOA national rally in Oshkosh, Wisconsin
on the nd of July this year.
