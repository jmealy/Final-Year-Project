For Sale  Honda CBR (Hurricane).  I bought the bike at the end of
last summer and although I love it, the bills are forcing me to part with
it.  The bike has a little more than  miles on it and runs very strong.
It is in nead of a tune-up and possibly break pads but the rubber is good.
I am also tossing in a TankBag and a KIWI Helmet.  Asking $. or best
offer.  Add hits newspaper -- and Micronews --.  Interested 
parties can call -- during the day and - in the evenings
no later than :PM.
