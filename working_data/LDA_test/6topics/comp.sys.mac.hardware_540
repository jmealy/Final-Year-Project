Hi there,

when I run Disk First Aid on my external hard drive (Quantum LPS ) I get the followinf
message: Error -: Missing thread record (TarID=; TarBlock )
Disk First Aid is not able to fix this problem, Norton Utils doesn't find it at all.
When I use Norton Disk editor to look at TarBlock  I can read something like "DirReservedArea"

My question: How can I get rid of this error (without reformatting of course)
