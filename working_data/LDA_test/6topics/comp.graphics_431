  Does anyone know how to convert a targa or similar  bit picture into a list
 of R G B values and then convert back to targa after doing operations on the p
ixels R G B codes.
ex.  Targa ---->pixel 
pixel etc....
If no one can help me with this could someone explain how the  bit data is st
ored in the targa file and also how its stored in the  bit targas.   Thanks
