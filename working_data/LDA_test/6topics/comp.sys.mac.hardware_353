Sorry if this is a FAQ.  I don't normally read comp.sys.mac.hardware.
I am purchasing a couple of Centris 's.  I configured the systems
as follows:

	Eight () Mb RAM
	Ethernet
	 Mb VRAM
	Math CoProcessor option

My purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent
me the Apple summary documentation to prove it.  I ordered the coprocessor
option, but I'm really not sure that we needed it.  I thought the ' chip
had a math coprocessor built into it.  Has Apple had a math coprocessor chip
architectured to keep up with the speed of the ' chip in the Centris ?
I am concerned that I may have set up a hardware bottleneck.  Please send your
responses to:  David_Anthony_Guevara@cup.portal.com.  I will summarize if there
is enough interest.  Thanks!
