In my last post I referred to Michael Adams as "Nick."  Completely my
error; Nick Adams was a film and TV actor from the ''s and early ''s
(remember Johnny Yuma, The Rebel?).  He was from my part of the country,
and Michael's email address of "nmsca[...]" probably helped confuse things
in my mind.  Purely user headspace error on my part.  Sorry.
