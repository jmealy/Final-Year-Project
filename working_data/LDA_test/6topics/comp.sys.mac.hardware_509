well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after
starting life as a k way back in .  sooo, i'm in the market for a
new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be...

i'm looking into picking up a powerbook  or maybe  and have a bunch
of questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer:

* does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook
introductions are expected?  i'd heard the c was supposed to make an
appearence "this summer" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i
don't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had
more info...

* has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the
ones the duo's just went through recently?

* what's the impression of the display on the ?  i could probably swing
a  if i got the Mb disk rather than the , but i don't really have
a feel for how much "better" the display is (yea, it looks great in the
store, but is that all "wow" or is it really that good?).  could i solicit
some opinions of people who use the  and  day-to-day on if its worth
taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize
this is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the
machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody
who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).

* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)

thanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a
summary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the
corner... :( )
