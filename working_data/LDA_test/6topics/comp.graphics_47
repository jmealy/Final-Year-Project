I've just had the good fortune to be hired by Electronic Arts as Senior
Computer Graphics Artist at the Vancouver, Canada office.  :^)

The timing has a lot to do with the DO which EA is putting a lot of resources
into.  I do not know of any titles to be developed as yet but will be happy to
post as things develop.  I start there May .
