Apparently that last post was a little hasy, since I
called around to more places and got quotes for less
than  and .  Liability only, of course.

Plus, one palced will give me CC for my car + liab on the bike for
only  total, which ain't bad at all.

So I won't go with the first place I called, that's
fer sure.
