I have a new  MHz Motorola  that I am willing to sell if I get
a good enough offer.  It is still in its static free sealed package.

If I don't get a good enough offer, I will use it to replace my LC.

Any takers?  

Supposedly you can get one of these for $.  However, at the moment the
demand is higher than the supply so I think $ is a good round number.
I will pay shipping, of course.
