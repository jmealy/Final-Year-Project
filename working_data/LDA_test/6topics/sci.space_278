ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 

(Flight V. was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS- series 
Galaxy IV satellite, but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight.)

The th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA C and ARSENE 
satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), with 
inclination reduced to  degrees and apogee altitude increased by  km.
This will be the th launch of an Ariane  and the first in the L 
configuration, with  liquid strap-on boosters (PAL).  It will be launched
from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA , in Kourou - French 
Guiana.

The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is , kg
of which , kg represents the satellite mass.  The total vehicle mass
at liftoff is , kg.


Required Orbit Characteristics:
  Perigee Altitude .....  km
  Apogee Altitude ...... , km at injection 
  Inclination ..........    degrees


The Ariane L lift-off for Flight  is scheduled on Thursday,
April , , as soon as possible within the following launch 
window:

LAUNCH VEHICLE:

Ariane L.  This is a three-stage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid 
fueled strap-on boosters.  The first stage (L) is built by Aerospatiale,
and is powered by  liquid fueled Viking V engines.  The second stage (L)
is built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine.  Both the
Viking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP.  The first and second stages
use a biliquid UH/NO fuel. The third stage (H) is built by Aerospatiale,
and is powered by a cryogenic H/O fueled HM-B engine built by SEP. The two
strap-on boosters (PAL) are each powered by a Viking VI engine, also built 
by SEP, which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages.  
The fully assembled launch vehicle stands  meters high on the pad.  
It uses the Type  Ariane Short payload fairing.

PAYLOADS:

ASTRA C is the third spacecraft in the fleet of "Societe Europeenne
des Satellites" to broadcast direct TV to homes all over Europe.
Built by Hughes, it will be the second HS- launched by Ariane.

LAUNCH COVERAGE:

All Ariane missions are broadcast live via satellite from Kourou. 
Coverage begins at  minutes before launch and continues until 
all payloads have been deployed.  This mission will likely be carried
in the US on Galaxy , however it could be Galaxy  or another satellite.
(What is the European satellite normally used for Ariane coverage?)
