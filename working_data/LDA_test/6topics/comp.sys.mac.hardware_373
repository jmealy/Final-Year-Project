I also suffer from these video "artefacts". My configuration is a
Centris , /, MB VRAM with a NEC FG. It only happens at
x, in bit colour with virtual memory off during scrolling. This
occurs when the VRAM SIMMS are installed as well as removed.
It seems that the  does not like x.

Does anyone *not* have these problems in the above mentioned
conditions?
