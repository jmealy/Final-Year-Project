I called the Texas bill tracking people (/-) again today 
regarding HB  -- Concealed Carry.  Well, it was supposed to come
up for a vote this past Wednesday, but the bill got sent back to
the Public Safety Committee.  The PSC gave it a favorable rating
AGAIN, and the bill must now be scheduled for debate by
the Calendars Committee AGAIN.
