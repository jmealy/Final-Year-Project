I suspect that you think that this is less lethal than the typical
"assault weapon".  You are wrong.  Compared to what most criminals use, a
mm with military ammo (FMJs), or a military rifle (use is extremely
rare), . or .mm with military ammo (FMJs), the . H&R magnum with
"civie" bullets is more lethal.  Most of the arms which criminals (and
the military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance.
