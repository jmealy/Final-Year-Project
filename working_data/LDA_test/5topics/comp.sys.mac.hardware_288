Hi there,


I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM. I have tried to find info on this
but I could not get precise answers.

On one hand, we have a Quadra  with a " monitor, which is capable of
-bit color. How much VRAM does it have?
On the other hand, we have a Quadra  with a " monitor, which is capable
of -bit color only, so it must have  Ko of VRAM.

I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the  and put them in the  so that
both machines have -bit color capability.
Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the ?
From the documentation I have, the Quadra  must get  Mo VRAM to have
-bit color, is that correct?

Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the  documentation, they
seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?


Thanks for your help!
