The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use ns SIMMs in
a MHz machine, but that you could use ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just
pointed out that if you could only use ns SIMMs in a MHz machine, you can't
use ns SIMMs in anything faster than a . MHz machine. Bank switching and
caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory
access).
