Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together
the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue. 

Afterall, Apple's literature is not always % correct. A funny one I
noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD
capability refer to the "auto inkjet" feature. This should have read "auto
inject" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen from
Apple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess
that someone edited the copy, saw "inject" and thought it was a typo and
changed it to the more familiar word "inkjet".
