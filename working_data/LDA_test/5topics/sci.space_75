hurtful but The Soviets winning would have been crushing. That could have
been *the* technological turning point for the US turning us

reserved attitude like the Soviet Program today.

Kennedy was gone by \, the war was still on is the east, I think
the program would have stalled badly and the goal of the moon
by  would have been dead with Nasa trying to figure were they went wrong.
