I've got a Belstaff tankbag on my FJ, and it ain't too good. It's
difficult to fix it securely cos of the the tank/fairing/sidepanel layout,
and also with the bars on full lock the bag touches the handlebar switches,
so you get the horn on full left lock and the starter motor on full right!!
If I was buying another I think I'd go for a magnetic one.
