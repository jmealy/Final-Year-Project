Hello all,

If anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and
motherboard of a Quadra  please let me know.  I have tried some mail

with over $ to get just the case.  In my eyes this seems about $-$
to much.  Any comments?  I currently own the guts of a .

Please email me or post to this group w/ info,
