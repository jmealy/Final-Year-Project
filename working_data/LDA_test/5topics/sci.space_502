                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                             April , 
                              : AM PDT

Flight Sequence C is active, the Spacecraft subsystems and instrument
payload performing well in Array Normal Spin and outer cruise
configuration, with uplink and downlink via the High Gain Antenna; uplink
at  bps, downlink at the  K Engineering data rate.

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April , all
payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault
protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory
was successfully reloaded on Monday, April .  To prepare for
Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight
Sequence C on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload
Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning
beginning at : AM.

Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to
perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for
analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator
testing will take place on Monday .

The Flight Sequence C uplink will occur on Sunday, April , with
activation at Midnight, Monday evening April .  C has been modified to
include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C due
to Contingency Mode entry on April .  These Magnetometer instrument
calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the
spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.
This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements
which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require
the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state
and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points
in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.
