                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                               POST-LAUNCH
                           April  - , 


SPACECRAFT

.  On April , cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

.  On April , a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test
and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were
performed using the LGA- (Low Gain Antenna #) over DSS- (Madrid  meter
antenna) and DSS- (Madrid  meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis
is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed
information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.

.  On April , a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

.  On April , the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)
advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS- (Goldstone
 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from  degrees
to  degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.

.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change
(greater than  DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance
measurement has.  The AC measurement reads  DN (. volts).  The DC
measurement has ranged from  DN (. volts) to  DN (. volts) and
currently reads  DN (. volts).  These measurements are consistent with
the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.

.  The Spacecraft status as of April , , is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -   watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - .rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately  degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and  degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- bps(coded)/LGA-
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting -  hours
           Time To Initiation -  hours


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April , , the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         ,, km (. AU)
	Distance from Sun           ,, km (. AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          , km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       ,, km
	Round Trip Light Time        minutes,  seconds
