: I am in the market for a bike and have recently found a 
: Honda VRF  at a dealership. The bike has about , miles
: and is around $. It has had two previous owners, both employees
: of the dealership who, I have been told, took very good care of the
: bike.

: I have two questions: ) Is this too many miles for a bike? I know this
: would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life
: span of bikes. ) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with
: prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is
: for cars?.

: Thanks for any advice you can give.

Mark,

  k is not too many miles on a VFR.  I sold my (well maintained)
' VFR with k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.
All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings
and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers
to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was
mint.

   As for price, $ seems a little steep.  I bought my ' with k
miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $.
There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.
I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $ dollar range.  They all
said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.

   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain
it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my
VFR is any indication, at k miles the fork springs were totally shot.
Progressive springs ($) fixed it right up.

Good luck,
