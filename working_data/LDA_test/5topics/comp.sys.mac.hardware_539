In the May issue of C't Magazine was an article about upgrading  models
of apple. They simply change crystals and add a fan.
Hammerhead: Centris  was able to work with  MHz (cooler prefered)
            and for  DM you get an  (MHz) which works with the
            appropriate crystal at full speed. (extra cooling required)    
            Centris  like Quadra  with extra cooling MHz works on
            most machines and for real power enthusiasts they used a
            Quadra  at  MHz wow! But for better description you should
            get this issue of C't (a german PC magazine!)
