It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand 
miles.  I don't know why.  I've had three new K bikes, and all three used a
bit of oil when new - max maybe . quart in first  miles; this soon quits
and by the time I had , miles on them the oil consumption was about zero.
I've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner
it stops using any oil.
