I bought a Bernoulli pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of
 diffrent storage solutions,
OPTICAL drives are SLOW, very slow compared to  to ms access of Bernoulli.

Since I needed additinol online storage (rather than just a backup or archiev
e disk), I choosed Bernoulli drive. I use Adobe Preimere and Quicktime movies
alot. you ran out of storage real fast.

IMHO, the best buy currently is the Bernoulli Multidisk. MB per cartridge
