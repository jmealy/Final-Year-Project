. The Mac II is supposed to have a socket for the MC PMMU chip. Could
anyone let me know where that socket is on the motherboard. I have obtained
a PMMU chip ( Mhz) from a surplus store, and would like to install it onto
my Mac II (circa ). But I cannot see the socket myself when I tried to
install it.

. Could anyone send me the pinouts for the Mac II SCSI DB- interface?


Thank you.
