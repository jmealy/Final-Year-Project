Flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at $
per floptical (= $. per megabyte), and I have seen them advertised
in MacWEEK at $ (< $. per megabyte).  For someone on a tight
budget, the fact that the minimal dollar increment for more storage is
less---$ versus $---sometimes matters.
