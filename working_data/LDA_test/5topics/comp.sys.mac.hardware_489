Can anyone tell me what the difference is between a K DRAM chip and a
K SIMM? I need the former (I think) to add memory to my Laserwriter
LS. Someone is offering to sell me K SIMMS he removed from an SE, but
I have a feeling this may not be the correct form of memory. The sockets
in the Laserwriter look like they want the spidery-shaped chips (there
are  sockets, each with, as I recall,  pins, arranged in two rows of ). Believe it or not, I've never actually seen a SIMM. Help appreciated.
