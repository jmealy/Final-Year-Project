Readers,

I have found that the cache upgrade options for the Mac IIsi include the
following:	) AE QuickSilver
		) Daystar Fastcache IIsi
		) Daystar ComboCache IIsi
		) LogiCache IIsi k cache

I'd be interested in hearing opinions on any or all of these options.
The other alternative is to upgrade to a CPU accelerator such as the
LogiCache  MHz. Ideas, comparisions?
