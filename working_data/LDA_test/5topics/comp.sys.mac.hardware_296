I don't know about the Instrutech boards (though I plan to check them out),
but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and S/N ratio of
many of the " bit" boards out there. The NI boards are very clearly
specified in terms of monotonicity, S/N ratio, accuracy, etc; and the
NB-A and NB-A have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
distortion that you'd expect from a good, true  bit converter. This is
not true for the Spectral Innovations boards, for example.
