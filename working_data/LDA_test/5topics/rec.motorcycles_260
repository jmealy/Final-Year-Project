Zero to very fast very quickly... lastest rumor is  hp at the rear wheel,
handles like a dream in a straight line to -, and then gets a tad upset
according to a review in Cycle World... cornering, er well, you can't have 
everything... Seriously, handling is probably as good as the big standards
of the early 's but not compareable to whats state of the art these days.

All this gleemed from reviews and discussions with owners. I too lust after
this bike.
