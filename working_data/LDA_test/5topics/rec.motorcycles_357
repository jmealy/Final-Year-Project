})  I only have about $- to work with, so that would have 
}to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too 
}ignorant to know I need to buy)

The following numbers are approximate, and will no doubt get me flamed:

Helmet (new, but cheap)					$
Jacket (used or very cheap)				$
Gloves (nothing special)				$ 
Motorcycle Safety Foundation riding course (a must!)	$

That leaves you between $ and $ (depending on the accuracy
of my numbers) to buy a used bike, get it registered, get it
insured, and get it running properly. I'd say you're cutting
it close. Perhaps if your parents are reasonable, and you indicated
your wish to learn to ride safely, you could get them to pick up
the cost of the MSF course and some of the safety gear. Early
holiday presents or whatever. Those are one-time (well, long-term
anyway) investments, and you could spend your money on the actual
bike, insurance, registration, and maintenance.
