From article <CowCB.np@world.std.com>, by tombaker@world.std.com (Tom A Baker):


My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically
known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked
that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't
set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code
and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew
'ok, if you see a warning no.  before liftoff, ignore it'.
