It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, () the
formatting software installs a driver on the disc, () if you insert the
disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's
memory and then controls the drive, and () if this driver is incompatible
with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written
Is that correct?
