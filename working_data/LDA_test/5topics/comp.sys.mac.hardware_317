Macintosh IIsi, /, ns.
Clock-upgraded IIsi works well at MHZ, however, does not work with
Nubus adaptor and k disk even though it can read/write k disk
atMHz. Interestingly, upgraded IIsi overcomes basically the fighting
between the Vedio and the System so that CPU never be reduced below  no
mater whether the cache is on or off. This is pretty useful when you
use the virtual memory of system .
