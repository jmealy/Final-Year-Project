Thanks for the information!

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri-
helion and aphelion are then given by p(-e) and p(+e), i.e., about
. and . AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are . and . AU.
If  was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet
ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than  AU to Jupiter's --
which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could
get under Jupiter's influence.


Where  Jupiter radius = , km = , mi = . AU.  So the
 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.
Is that the case for the  figure as well?
