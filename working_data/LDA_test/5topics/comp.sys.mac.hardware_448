I'm looking for a Cache card for my IIsi. I can spend $ Max for it,
	what i need is  kb cache with a fpu socket and a dual slot adapter.
	Or at least a passe_through connector so i can keep my graphic card.
	I need your advice about the best card i can buy. How much performance
	increase i should expect, does the performance increase between the
	 and  kb Cache worths the price difference ?. And what's the best
	price i can get for such a card (i really need to spare each possible
	$). 
	I have an Ethernet card for the LC with fpu. I don't think it would
	work for the IIsi but the fpu is socketed. Do you think i can take the
	fpu out of the card and put it in the empty fpu socket ?. Would it work
	at  Mhz ?. If not, how much should i pay for an extra fpu ?.
