To display Millions of colors on a " monitor you need MB of VRAM
in the Q.


    Correct. This is the amount of on-board VRAM that the Q comes
with.


    Yes this is possible. Technically, you only need to take out  of
the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything
because the  cannot really do anything with .MB of VRAM. It only
knows MB and MB.


    Yes, this is correct. You get to MB by putting  k VRAM SIMMs
into the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q's motherboard.
