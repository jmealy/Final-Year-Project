I had a friend in Pittsburgh who had a CBC with the dual-range
tranny on it.  He usually only used the "economy" range to get an overdrive
sixth gear out of it.  He had  miles on it when it was stolen.  It was
recovered shortly after that, repaired, and, for all I know, it's still going
strong.

	The CBC was a shaft-driven overbore version of the CB and was
made for exactly one year (yep, head and base gaskets are VERY expensive).
Helluva bike.

A data point,
