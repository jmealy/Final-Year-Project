This is an annual time of prayer organized by the Focus on the Family
organization.  If you have not heard about it on your Christian radio
station or at your local church, call them and they may be able to
give you the information.

Many cities in the San Francisco bay area have local coordinators
organizing the time and the place to meet to pray.  In San Francisco,
Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose, people will be meeting at ~:pm at
each city's City Hall.
