A quick query for Powerbook gurus:
Tom Spearman, in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options
mentioned that there exist  versions of their Powerbook -
batteries: a . amp hour one (M/A), a . amp hour one,
(M/B) and a . amp hour one (M/C). Anyone out there
know how to determine which of these a battery is? I looked at my
battery and there is no obvious exterior indication. I contacted
Tom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and he
didn't know either. Anyone out there know the answer?
	Thanks!
