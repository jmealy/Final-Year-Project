I have a Macc IIci and a Color scanner.
I scanned a picture at  dpi. When I try to print
it on my HP color printer, after  minutes of
making noise, the mac hangs. I would need to reboot it.
What does this mean? Do I need to buy more memory? I have
. MB now. I also have about  MB of disk free, and the
scanned picture is about  MB.
