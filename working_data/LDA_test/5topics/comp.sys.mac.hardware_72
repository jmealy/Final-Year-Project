I'm interested in getting an external hard drive for my SE/.  I've
got an internal MB that's pretty full, even with compression s/w.  
Alot of people talk about $/MB, what's a good ratio?  I'm thinking of adding
either an  or a  (or ).  What brands would people suggest?  Finally,
places to buy from?  Are more popular mail-order places better to order from
or the places that JUST sell hard drives (e.g. ones that advertise in the back
of MacWorld and MacUser).

Thanks in advance.  If e-mail replies are sent, I'll compile them and post
them.
