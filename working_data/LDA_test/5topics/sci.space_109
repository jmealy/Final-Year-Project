[On the issue of 'burning' nuclear wastes using particle beams...]



I sometimes wonder if your newsfeed gives you different articles than
everyone else, Pat.  Just a *few* corrections:

) I never 'defended' kHz power, other than as something reasonable
to GO LOOK AT.

) I have also never opposed a *research project* into feasibility of
the spalling reactor approach to 'cleaning' nuclear waste -- I simply
doubt it could be made to work in the Real World (tm), which ought to
become clear fairly quickly during a research program into feasibility
(sort of like what happened to  kHz power -- it proved to have a
down-side that was too expensive to overcome).

I figure  things wrong in a single sentence is a high enough fault
density for even you, Pat.
