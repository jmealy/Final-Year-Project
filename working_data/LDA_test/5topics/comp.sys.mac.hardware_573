I am trying to put a MB drive from my LC into a case.  It is a Conner
CPA.  I can't figure out which jumpers are the SCSI ID jumpers.
Is anyone familiar with this drive?

At the end of the drive (oposite the  pin pibbon connector), there
are eleven pins which look like this:


        o o o o o   o   
          o o o o   o   

         L  CR   C

where the "o" are pins, and the "L CR C" represent some of the
silk screen notation near these pins.

Elsewhere on the board there are four jumper pads marked E,E,E,E
on the silk screen.

Does anyone know where the SCSI ID A,A,A pins are, and where the
drive activity light LED should be plugged into?
