I just got through listening to the  o'clock news on Channel  here in
Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
"months of investigation" for their raid. 

I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused
of stockpiling a bunch of "mm and . ammunition that can be used in M
and M assault rifles". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had
aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't
heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
illegal was an M- grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)

Months of investigation! For this + people died!
