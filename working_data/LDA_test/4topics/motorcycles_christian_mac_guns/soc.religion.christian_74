Sorry, but I think this interpretation of the Matthew  parables is
nonsense. I.e.,


Matthew : explains that by "leaven of the Pharisees" Jesus was simply
referring to their teaching; not sin/corruption/heresy.

Jesus gaves His apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that
the gates of hell would not prevail against His church.
