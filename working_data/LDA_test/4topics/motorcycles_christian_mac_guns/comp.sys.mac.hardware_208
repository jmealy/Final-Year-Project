I'm thinking about upgrading my  MHz to the  version.  Has anyone
had any experience with the accelerator, and if so - what do you think?
Any problems, what are the speedometer results?, is it much faster than
the MHz?  Basically, I'd appreciate hearing all about this product.  Please
respond via email, and I'll summarize if there's a big response.  thanks
in advance, Andrew
