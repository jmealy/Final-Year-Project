Gun safety classes sound good in theory, but they kind of remind me of
the "literacy tests" used in the bad old days to keep blacks from voting.
They came with the "grandfather clause": if your grandfather could vote,
you could vote.  Sort of like the gun safety laws that only let the
political ass-kissers have guns.
