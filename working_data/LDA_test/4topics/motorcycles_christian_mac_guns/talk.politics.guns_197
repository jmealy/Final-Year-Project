Well, this sounds good to me.  The key is Section ()(c)(), which
will effectively open up the Federal court system to all the folks
who can't afford to adopt an Attorney with whom to fight city hall.
All of you who've been saying "hey, isn't that illegal?" could just
go hire your own Attorneys on a pay-if-you-win ("contingency fee")
basis, and sue the bums ...   :-)

What you can do now:

()  Write your Representative, and ask them to co-sponsor HR .

()  Write Representative Roscoe Bartlett, the sponsor --

        Representative Roscoe Bartlett
         Cannon House Office Building
        Washington, D.C. 

     -- to tell him who your own Representative is, and that you've
     asked them to join him as a co-sponsor of HR .

()  Contact Gun Owners of America --

          Gun Owners of America
           Forbes Place
          Springfield, Virginia 

     -- which has committed to lobby on behalf of HR .

()  For those of us with a RealJob (TM), find out how to reach
     Representative Bartlett's campaign fund (I'm working on it)
     and toss in a few bucks.  You can bet your bippy that he's
     going to be one of the HCI "targets" in the next election,
     which isn't that far away ().
