I have a line on a Ducati GTS  model with k on the clock.  Runs
very well, paint is the bronze/brown/orange faded out, leaks a bit of oil
and pops out of st with hard accel.  The shop will fix trans and oil 
leak.  They sold the bike to the  and only owner.  They want $, and
I am thinking more like $K.  Any opinions out there?  Please email me.
Thanks.  It would be a nice stable mate to the Beemer.  Then I'll get
a jap bike and call myself Axis Motors!
