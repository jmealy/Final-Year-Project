For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very*
bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e.
stage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked
it, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a M ). It is
also too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels
are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do
with tarrifs being lifted I think). 

In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about
$ to $ and a good overhead projector about $ to $. For
that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam
projector, but sacrifice portability.
