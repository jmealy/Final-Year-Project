of course it was in Dale's post, just not in the words that MacUser 
used.  ROM accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands
has been rewritten (inside the ROM) to take advantage of the 
addressing modes.  commands that do fills should be slightly faster
since the new instructions fetch  bytes at a time versus one.
