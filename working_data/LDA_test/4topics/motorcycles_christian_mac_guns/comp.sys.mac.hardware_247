I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver ., 
and it works on System.  Course, I only use the SWA Dutch
and SWA Swiss fonts that came with it, due to the x size
requirement to print to the HP. (ie: must have pnt definition
to print a pnt font)  When I upgraded,  I talked to Orange
Micro, and they state that ver . of Grappler LS definitely
works with System.  However, the upgrade was US$, so I
passed.

Hope this helps?
