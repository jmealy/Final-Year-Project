All right people, this inane bug wibbling is just getting to much.  I
propose we split off a new group.
rec.motorcycles.nutrition 
to deal with the what to do with squashed bugs thread.

What?!?!? Haven't you heard about cross-posting??!?!? Leave it intact and
simply ignore the basenotes and/or responses which have zero interest for
a being of your stature and discriminating taste. ;-)

Yesterday, while on Lonoak Rd, a wasp hit my faceshield with just
enough force to glue it between my eyes, but not enough to kill it as
the legs were frantically wiggling away and I found that rather, shall
we say, distracting. I flicked it off and wiped off the residue at the
next gas stop in Greenfield. :-) BTW, Lonoak Rd leads from # into
King City although we took Metz from KC into Greenfield.
