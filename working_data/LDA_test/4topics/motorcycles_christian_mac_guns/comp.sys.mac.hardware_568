What I did NOT get with my drive (CDi) is the System Install CD you
listed as #.  Any ideas about how I can get one?  I bought my IIvx /
from Direct Express in Chicago (no complaints at all -- good price & good
service).

BTW, I've heard that the System Install CD can be used to boot the mac;
however, my drive will NOT accept a CD caddy is the machine is off.  How can
you boot with it then?
