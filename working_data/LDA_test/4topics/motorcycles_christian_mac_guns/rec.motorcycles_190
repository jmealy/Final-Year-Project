: I am in the market for a bike and have recently found a 
: Honda VRF  at a dealership. The bike has about , miles
: and is around $. It has had two previous owners, both employees
: of the dealership who, I have been told, took very good care of the
: bike.

: I have two questions: ) Is this too many miles for a bike? I know this
: would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life
: span of bikes. ) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with
: prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is
: for cars?.

: Thanks for any advice you can give.
