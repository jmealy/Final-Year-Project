I have a k VRAM chip for sale. Worked fine in my LCII and will give 
colors on  x  size screen. Asking $. I'll cover postage. Speaking
of which, does anyone know what the best way to send a chip is. I have a
plastic antistatic sleeve, but what's the best way to send it? In an
envelope? First class? All info appreciated.
