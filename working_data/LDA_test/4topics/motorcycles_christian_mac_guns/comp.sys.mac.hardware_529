The PowerBook  hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer.  Nor does the .
The Mac Portable had one, and I think the PowerBook  had one.  I don't
know about the newer PowerBooks, but I kind of doubt it.  I got bit by
this too, and it took my a while rooting around on the developer CD
before I found this out.
