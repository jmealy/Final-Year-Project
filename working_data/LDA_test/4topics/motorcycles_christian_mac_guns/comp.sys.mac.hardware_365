Hi there,

Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for
C regarding fpu?  In all Mac price lists I've seen, every C
has the message "fpu: optional".  I know from what we've discussed in this
newsgroup that all C have the fpu built in except the /
configuration.  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list?
I'm planning to buy the C //cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not.
Why say "optional" if it's built in?
Please, anybody help me understand this game.

Regards,
