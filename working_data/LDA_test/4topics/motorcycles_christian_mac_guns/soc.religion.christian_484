I would recommend "Essential Truthes of the Christian Faith" by RC Sproul.
It is copywrited  from Tyndale House Publishers. Sproul offers concise 
explanations, in simple language, of around  different Christian 
doctrines, grouped by subject. I think it would be particularly good for
newer Christians (and older Christians suffering spiritual malnutrition),
as it gives a Biblically sound basic treatment of the issues, avoiding 
long in-depth analysis that can wait until after you know the basics.
