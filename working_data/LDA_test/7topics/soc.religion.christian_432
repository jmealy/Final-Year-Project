Hi I am a Sociology student and I am currently researching into 
young offenders.  I am looking at the way various groups of 
children are raised at home.  At the moment I am formlulating 
information on discipline within the Christian home.

Please, if you are a parent in this catagory can you email me 
your response to the following questionaire.  All responses 
will be treated confidentially and will only be used to prepare 
stats.

offence?
