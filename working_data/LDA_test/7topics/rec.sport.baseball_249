Oh, lighten up.  What depresses me is that they might actually 
finish last, which I believe hasn't happened since their second season in 
.  Never mind that Gubizca is - with a . ERA, Gardner at .,
our main recent acquisitions (Lind, McReynolds, Jose) are averaging .,
David Cone is - (about how he was doing in KC before joining the Mets 
several years ago), our hitting sucks, and our pitching has collapsed, 
and we've won one game at home; they've won more games in their first ten
games than last year, and Brian McRae is actually batting over the 
Mendoza line!
