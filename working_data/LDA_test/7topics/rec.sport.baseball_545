I haven't been following the previous HR's.  But there are two, that I saw
live that would have to be up there (up where? there!).  
) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in .
It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter.
Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee
warming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP,
Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that
time (or so he told me and around  others on a recent venture into 
Montreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing.
Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the th.  The Expos almost
came back though...
) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in .  So close, yet, so
far.
and
) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left
the stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!
