After reading my local paper today, I found out that the Phillies
started the  season at -.  I am not as old as , but I've
heard many talk about the serious choke job the Phillies did that
season. They were ahead of the Cardinals by  games that season in
mid-August.  They managed to lose a bunch from then on and the
Cardinals took the division.  !!! games ahead and lost it.... I
hope this season is MUCH different.
