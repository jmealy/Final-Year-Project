Is it just me, or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield?  He 
misplayed Martinez fly-out into a double against the Expos, misplayed
Alou's single into a triple (Alou tagged out at rd after over-sliding 
the bag) and now he misplays another out into a  run triple...add in his
wonderful batting average and we have one heck of a player!
