I'd be willing to make two wagers:
) Snow doesn't win ROY.
) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.

I'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a
player, and he is on a losing team.

I'm skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is  this
year, and how many players play until they are ?  Not too many, and
most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were .

Could be wrong on either or both, but I think that's the smart way to
bet...
