According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the
highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst.
However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?

Using Alomar's opportunities ( groundballs,  possible double plays)
Alomar had  groundouts and turned  DPs.
Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%)  groundouts and  DPs.

Using Baerga's opportunites ( groundballs,  possible double plays).
Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%)  groundouts and  DPs.
Baerga had  groundouts and  DPs.

Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a 
different SS.

Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar
has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on
Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall.
