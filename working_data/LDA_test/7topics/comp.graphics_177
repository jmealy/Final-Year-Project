Hello,
I purchased my new  with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously 
Speedstar  compatible. Its name is "VGA  TrueColor".
It is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities VMODE, XMODE and
at least one more MODE, as well as some drivers for Lotus, Windows, etc.
Only one of the drivers is told to provide the TrueColor mode, namely
the Windows . driver.
Nowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the TrueColor mode.
Some articles in this group about the Speedstar  and some other facts
made me believe that my card is compatible to that one.

Does anybody out there know how this mode can be adjusted? How can I write
a driver which allows me to have . millions of colors with a resolution
of  x  with  Hz interlaced ?
