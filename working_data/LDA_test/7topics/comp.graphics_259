Why would it have to be much faster (it probably is) ? Assuming an ARM
is about as efficient as a MIPS R for integer calculations, doing
a Compact-Video-like digital video codec is an easy task. For Software
Motion Pictures (which is a lot like Compact Video, though it predates
it), we get  frames/sec. at x on a DECstation /. That
machine has a  Mhz MIPS R.
