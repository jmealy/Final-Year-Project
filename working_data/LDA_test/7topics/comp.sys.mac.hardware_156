Hi There,
	I am trying to find out a reliable Power Center, it is basically
a surge protector that sits below the monitor and has individual control
for each outlet. Some people have an opinion that none of them work well.
The ones that I could locate in Microcenter catalogue were:

Tripp Lite's Isobar Command COnsole ($)

Proxima Power Director (.)

Kensington Masterpiece Plus (.)

Has anyone used one of these? Could you please send me your feedback
on these?

thanks
