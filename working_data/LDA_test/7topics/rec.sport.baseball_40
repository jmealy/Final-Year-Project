This is what Jackson looked like in -, with everything converted
to a neutral park, on the basis of run production. His equivalent
average started at . in , was up to . in  and  in . So
let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a . level
of play.

That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top
ten in the league. The th best EQA in the AL in  was Dave
Winfield's .; Thomas was first at .. First in the NL was Bonds,
an incroyable .; tenth was Bip Roberts, .. But . is better
than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what
Mattingly had in  (.); what Felix Jose had the last two years;
just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan
Klesko's MLEs. 

He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his
baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.
That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The
media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a
good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the th best
hitter in the majors.
