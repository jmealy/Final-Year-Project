HELP!

	I just received my Falcon .. upgrade from Spectrum Holobyte today.
My SE is running Sys .. with mb of RAM. Like the instructions said, I only
installed Disk  (The program...no start up screen or music).

	I just downloaded Macsbug from ftp.apple.com like it said, and
installed it in my System folder. I restarted the mac an hour later, and it 
wouldn't completely boot off the internal HD. I get the "happy mac", then it
disappears, only to reappear and repeat the cycle continuously. I never even
get the "Welcome to Macintosh" message. Norton utilities fixed about  new
problems, but the same thing still happened.

	What do I do?

	Please e-mail to "orly@aludra.usc.edu"


		THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!
