The Command Loss Timer is part of the fault protection scheme of the
spacecraft.  If the Command Loss Timer ever countdowns to zero, then the
spacecraft assumes it has lost communications with Earth and will go 
through a set of predetermined steps to try to regain contact.  The
Command Loss Timer is set to  hours and reset about once a week during 
the cruise phase, and is set to a lower value during an encounter phase.
