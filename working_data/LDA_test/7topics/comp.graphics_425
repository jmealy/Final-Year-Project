I've used that reference, and found that I needed to go to their
original tech report:

	Maureen Stone and Tony DeRose,
	"Characterizing Cubic Bezier Curves"
	Xerox  EDL--, December 

This report can be obtained for free from:
Xerox Corporation
Palo Alto Research Center
 Coyote Hill Road
Palo Alto, California

The TOG paper was good, but this tech report had more interesting details ;-)
