How about some numbers here? Some kind of benchmark?
If you want, let me start it - DX- -  SPECint,  SPECfp .



Numbers? Pentium @MHz -  SPECint,  SPECfp .
	 PowerPC @MHz -  SPECint,  SPECfp . (Note this is the )
        (Alpha @MHz  -  SPECint, SPECfp - just for comparison)



Not in a clock-doubled system. There isn't a doubling in performance, but
it _is_ quite significant. Maybe about a % increase in performance.

Besides, for  wait state performance, you'd need a cache anyway. I mean,
who uses a processor that runs at the speed of ns SIMMs? Note that this
memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of . MHz.


Numbers?
