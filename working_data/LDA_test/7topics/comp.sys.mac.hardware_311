Can someone please help me understand the current situation
regarding SIMMS?

I have a IIsi which I will probably keep for another  years.

I would like to add more memory, ie go from  MB to  MB.

I know that I will need  x MB, ns or faster SIMMS.

Which SIMMS,  pin or  pin?
Would the SIMMS I get today be usable in  years with a 
newer, more powerful system?

Any insight would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Rob
