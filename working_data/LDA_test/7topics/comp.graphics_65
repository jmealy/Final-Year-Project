	Ahh no.  Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your
calculator.   color modes take a byte per pixel so  time  is
, which is k to be exact.  xx only takes k but I
don't think it is a BIOS mode.  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do
that either.  If a VGA card has k I bet it can do both x and
x.  That by definition is SVGA, though not very high SVGA.
