I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by others
to be interesting.  Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these
were completed before the first pitch. :-)

AL East
.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division
.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.
.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect
.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop
.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing
.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak
.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than th

Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top
           gets pitching should win it.
.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success
.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?
.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.
.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close
.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here
.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs
.  California Angels - will win no games

NL East
.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!
.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga
.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected
.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a "team"
.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me
.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing
.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing

NL West - The  best teams in baseball are in this division.
.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern
.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all
.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to  than 
.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 
.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants
.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink
.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.


NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting
                            what I said in my NL West comment.)
ALCS  New York d. Minnesota

World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be
                                     fashionable again

NL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff
NL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo
AL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it
AL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))
