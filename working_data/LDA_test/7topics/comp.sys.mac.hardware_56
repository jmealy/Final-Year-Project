I've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro  memory
upgrade.

I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi
at Apple Customer Assistance.  She tells me that those who
purchased the LaserWriter Pro  in a  megabyte (dpi, no
greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers
who are supposed provide the -meg memory upgrade.  For those
who don't know, the extra -meg will allow printing at dpi 
or greyscale (at dpi).

If the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their
hardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance 
---, -- (corporate number).

Regards,

Glenn
