To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three
homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the 
Cards and the Yanks.  He hit three  times.  I am almost sure about this. In
case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe
Ruth and is .  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan
Gonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe .  I know that 
he had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record
books at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I 
am wrong.  
	Onto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I
can't get McPaper consistently around here.  
comment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals
that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could 
hit with the power of  but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish
with . and - hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  
leadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base % of the time if I'm 
lucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got  steals
already.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I
haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going
to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this
year is stealing bases.
Sheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.
Witness Phillips batting .+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,
or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.
Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '?   or is 
this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone 
seen him pitch the two good games?
score for today, Sunday april :  Padres , St Louis .  Padres sweep the
Cardinals as Gwynn goes  for  with a homer.  Sheffield and Tueful also homer
in a winning cause.
