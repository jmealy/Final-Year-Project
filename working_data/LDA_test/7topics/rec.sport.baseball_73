Wasn't Hulett injured yesterday after being hit in the face with a ball
while running bases?  I heard something about him recieving stiches and a
possible broken nose.  Is he at the park?


Let's see how they feel when he's  and  with a . ERA.  I have my
doubts about Fernando.


Well, when a fan favorite gets dumped, he's gonna get an outstanding
ovation on his first return.  Let's add up the ovations Cal has recieved
over the years during the game and compare that to Billy.

BTW, Sutcliffe's getting knocked around pretty good.  Rangers up  -  in
the bottom of the fourth.
