In regards to fractal commpression, I have seen  fractal compressed "movies".
They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a  gray scale "movie" of
Casablanca, it was .MB and had  minutes of  fps video.  It was a little
grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only  minutes but it
had  bit color with fps and measured in at .MB.

I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many 
other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don't know what
kind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" I saw but the guy
that showed them to me said it took - minutes per frame to generate.  But as
I said above playback was  or more frames per second.  And how else could you
put  minutes on one floppy disk?
