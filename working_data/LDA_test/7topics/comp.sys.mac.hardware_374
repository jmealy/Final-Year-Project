To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information
already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:

A/D:  bit converter, with  bit accuracy to  kHz,  bit accuracy to
 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are  multiplexed
inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the
same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate
must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have  unknown quality bits
at  kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national
Instruments, at the same sample rate.

D/A:  bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of
the  output channels has its own converter.
