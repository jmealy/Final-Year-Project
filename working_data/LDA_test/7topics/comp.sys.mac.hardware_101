Well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face:

"Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own?"

Here's why- People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a  processor
in it. Apple can't deliver that right now because the  saps too much
power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How
does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing
PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a
unique ability to give users that  power in a "Semi-Portable" fashion.
By plunking the  into the Dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk.
On the road, that mhz  should be able to handle most of your needs.
Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-)
So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in
parallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypothetical
now...
