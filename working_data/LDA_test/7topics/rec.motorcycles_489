Heavy for a beginner bike it is;  pounds it isn't, except maybe in

My regulator lasted over , miles, and didn't overcharge the battery.
The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though,
tending to melt their insulation.  I suspect they were underspecified;

Battery access on the earlier bikes doesn't require tank removal.
After you learn the drill, it's pretty straightforward.
