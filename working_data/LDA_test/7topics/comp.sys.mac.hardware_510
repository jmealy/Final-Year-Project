I have been using the PLI (SONY) ." MO drive and now a Sharp color
scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD $ terminator on my Q. 
No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.

Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the
end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and
others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations
cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be
disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 
boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be
disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the "experts".

My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they
must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO
drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

Good luck.
