Are you for real?  How many Gold Gloves does Ozzie Smith have?  If a
guy hung around and hit  homers a year for  years, wouldn't he
be a given for the Hall?  Is defense not just as important?  And if
Robin Yount couldn't hit, why would he have stuck around long enough
to get , hits?  Are you saying , hits is a fluke?  ,
hits is no big deal?  

I agree, Garvey and Morris don't deserve it. 


Well, based on your argument, Nolan Ryan doesn't deserve the Hall of
Fame.  He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time
and could throw hard.  Very few  game winning seasons, lots of
losing seasons, lots of walks.  No Cy Young awards.  How does Nolan
Ryan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated  or  Major
League seasons, won  divisons,  World Series, and won half of his
teams games in ?  He doesn't compare.  Not even close.
