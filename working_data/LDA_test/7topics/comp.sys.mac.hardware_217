The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than
Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.


That's not true. Only the DECstation / comes with a Thinwire
(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The /, / and /
all have a single -pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly
remembered this because when got the / first and I thought all
of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered
DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used
with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.

My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:

() If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add
    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going
    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which
    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least  ports.
    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it
    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).

() On the Mac side, you will need:
    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).
    - MacX (make sure you get version .; .. won't run on System .).
    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v., you should be
      getting MacTCP v.. with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).
    - you may or may not need a ohm terminator depending on the
      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is
      self-terminated or not.
    - configure MacTCP to use "Ethernet".

() On the DECstation side, you will need:
    - for a Model , you will only need a T-connector.
    - for Models , , , , you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.
      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the
      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable
      (a -pin AUI male to a -pin AUI female cable).
    - get a ohm terminator.

Your two-machine network will look like this:
