Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the 
Powerbook , here are a couple of the answers:
() Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes
() What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the  
running at . Mhz.
() Does the Mac Portable run system ? Yes, although it does use up a 
lot of memory.
() Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors 
that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors 
sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell 
memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most 
memory you can address is either  or  megabytes, depending on whether 
the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine 
California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. MB - 
$,  MB, $, and  MB $. I still see several ads in macuser that 
are selling  MB modules for $. Wide variety in pricing here.
() What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-  MB HD with an 
average access time of about  ms.
() Is the screen better that the PB ? Heavens yes! The PB  is a 
backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move 
your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or 
non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.

Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay 
for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to 
sell a MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal  bps modem for about 
$. Or a  MB Backlit Portable with an internal  bps modem for 
about $. 

The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got 
one they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright
