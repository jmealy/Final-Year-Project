Up until last week, I have been running POVray v. on my / under DOS
without any major problems.  Over Easter I increased the memory from Meg to
Meg, and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS.  I had
a go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win. on the same system
and it now works fine, even if a lot slower.  I would like to go back to 
using POVray directly under DOS, anyone any ideas???
