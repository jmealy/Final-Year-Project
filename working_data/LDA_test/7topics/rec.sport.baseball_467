A lot of teams carry  catchers on their  man roster,
but the rd catcher is seldom ever used.  He is only
insurance in case of extra innings or the nd catcher
is injured during a game.     So to free up this roster
spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not
invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:

If the last roster catcher on a team is
injured during a game, the team is permitted
to substitute in his place for defensive purposes
a catcher who has previously been yanked from
the game.   

Given this rule, a team wouldn't need  roster
catchers.  The rd catcher could be playing
in AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.
