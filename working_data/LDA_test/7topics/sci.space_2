CONSTANTS AND EQUATIONS FOR CALCULATIONS

    This list was originally compiled by Dale Greer. Additions would be
    appreciated.

    Numbers in parentheses are approximations that will serve for most
    blue-skying purposes.

    Unix systems provide the 'units' program, useful in converting
    between different systems (metric/English, etc.)

    NUMBERS

	 m/s	 ()  -- Earth orbital velocity at  km altitude
	 m/s	 ()  -- Earth orbital velocity at  km (geosync)
	 km		 ()  -- Mean radius of Earth
	 km		 ()  -- Equatorial radius of Earth
	 km		 ()  -- Mean radius of Moon
	.e kg	 (e)  -- Mass of Earth
	.e kg	 (e)  -- Mass of Moon
	.e kg	 (e)  -- Mass of Sun
	.e m^/s^ (e)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Earth

	.e m^/s^ (e) -- Gravitational constant times mass of Sun

	 megaton (MT) TNT = about .e J or the energy equivalent of
	about . kg ( gm) of matter. Ref: J.R Williams, "The Energy Level

	Force Base, New Mexico, . Also see "The Effects of Nuclear
	Weapons", compiled by S. Glasstone and P.J. Dolan, published by the

    EQUATIONS

	Where d is distance, v is velocity, a is acceleration, t is time.
	Additional more specialized equations are available from:

	    ames.arc.nasa.gov:pub/SPACE/FAQ/MoreEquations


	For constant acceleration
	    d = d + vt + .at^
	    v = v + at
	  v^ = ad

	Acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) of radius r and
	    rotation period t:

	    a =  pi** r / t^

	For circular Keplerian orbits where:
	    Vc	 = velocity of a circular orbit
	    Vesc = escape velocity
	    M	 = Total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
	    G	 = Gravitational constant (defined below)
	    u	 = G * M (can be measured much more accurately than G or M)
	    K	 = -G * M /  / a
	    r	 = radius of orbit (measured from center of mass of system)
	    V	 = orbital velocity
	    P	 = orbital period
	    a	 = semimajor axis of orbit

	    Vc	 = sqrt(M * G / r)
	    Vesc = sqrt( * M * G / r) = sqrt() * Vc
	    V^  = u/a
	    P	 =  pi/(Sqrt(u/a^))
	    K	 = / V** - G * M / r (conservation of energy)

	    The period of an eccentric orbit is the same as the period
	       of a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis.

	Change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
	circular orbit:

	    delta V =  sqrt(GM/r) sin (phi/)

	Energy to put mass m into a circular orbit (ignores rotational
	velocity, which reduces the energy a bit).

	    GMm (/Re - /Rcirc)
	    Re = radius of the earth
	    Rcirc = radius of the circular orbit.

	Classical rocket equation, where
	    dv	= change in velocity
	    Isp = specific impulse of engine
	    Ve	= exhaust velocity
	    x	= reaction mass
	    m	= rocket mass excluding reaction mass
	    g	= . m / s^

	    Ve	= Isp * g
	    dv	= Ve * ln((m + x) / m)
		= Ve * ln((final mass) / (initial mass))

	Relativistic rocket equation (constant acceleration)

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(a*t/c)
	    d = c**/a * (cosh(a*t/c) - )
	    v = c * tanh(a*t/c)

	Relativistic rocket with exhaust velocity Ve and mass ratio MR:

	    at/c = Ve/c * ln(MR), or

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(Ve/c * ln(MR))
	    d = c**/a * (cosh(Ve/C * ln(MR)) - )
	    v = c * tanh(Ve/C * ln(MR))

	Converting from parallax to distance:

	    d (in parsecs) =  / p (in arc seconds)
	    d (in astronomical units) =  / p

	Miscellaneous
	    f=ma    -- Force is mass times acceleration
	    w=fd    -- Work (energy) is force times distance

	Atmospheric density varies as exp(-mgz/kT) where z is altitude, m is
	molecular weight in kg of air, g is local acceleration of gravity, T
	is temperature, k is Bolztmann's constant. On Earth up to  km,

	    d = d*exp(-z*.e-)

	where d is density, d is density at km, is approximately true, so

	    d@km ( ft) = d*.
	    d@ km ( ft) = d*.
	    d@ km ( ft) = d*.
	    d@ km ( ft) = d*.

		    Atmospheric scale height	Dry lapse rate
		    (in km at emission level)	 (K/km)
		    -------------------------	--------------
	    Earth	    .			    .
	    Mars	    			    .
	    Venus	    .			    .
	    Titan	    			    .
	    Jupiter	    			    .
	    Saturn	    			    .
	    Uranus	    			    .
	    Neptune	    			    .
	    Triton	    			    

	Titius-Bode Law for approximating planetary distances:

	    R(n) = . + . * ^N Astronomical Units (N = -infinity for
	    Mercury,  for Venus,  for Earth, etc.)

	    This fits fairly well except for Neptune.
