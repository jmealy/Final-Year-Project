Ok all you trivia buffs, I have a good one for you.

.  Prior to the foul bunt rule what is the record for the most foul balls
by  batter during one at bat?

.  Total pitches?

.  Who was the batter?

.  Who was the pitcher?

.  Same as - except after the foul bunt rule.

Associated data would be nice too (such as date, location, teams, etc.)
