ha... all this talk about changing the clock speed of the q makes me ask??
 if i replaced the mhz  in my plus with a mhz  with a mhz
clock occilater of its own( not shared by the rest of the mac... just the new
mhz)  would my mac work..... and if it would work.. would you think there
where be any problems with sound, vidio,scsi........

it seems like a simple solution to keepa dead slow mechine a
live a little longer..
   Oh if this would not work any idears on how to make it work???
		thanks
