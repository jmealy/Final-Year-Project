I saw the replay several times too.  No question about it.  Daryl missed
the ball, *then* the fan caught it.  Daryl is so tall that he had the
first shot at the ball.  Daryl's just whining again.  I think it shows a
lack of class when Tommy, Daryl and the Dodgers blame a single fan for
losing the game.  What about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball?
What about the pitchers that gave up  runs up to that point?  Sorry, Tommy.
If it were a - game and Daryl was  feet  inches tall, then maybe -
just maybe - you'd have an argument.
