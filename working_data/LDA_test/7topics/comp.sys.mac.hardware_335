I've been looking into getting a portable Mac to do some work and I've
had my eye on the PB . Lately, I've been seeing people with the old
portables, and they're selling for $ LESS that the PB s. What I
want to know is: what are the differences between them? All I know is
that the Portable is heavier, but the PB doesn't have an internal
drive. Here's what I NEED to know:

Does the portable support Appletalk/network connections?
What's the CPU inside a Portable? (?)
DOES THE PORTABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM ?????????
What's the maximum memory capacity of the Portable? Can you still get
	RAM (meaning: does it use special SIMMS?)
What kind of internal HD does it use?
Does the Portable have a better screen?

						THANX in advance.
