Um, the header said *career.*  Hodapp managed about  PA in his
nine years in the majors.

As for his "consistently over .," make that "three years in a row, 
preceded by a part-time year, plus his last year, with Boston."  Hodapp
only qualified for the batting title five times.  

Was he injured?  He retired right around his th birthday.

Anyway, Hodapp put up flashy numbers the year *everybody* put up
flashy numbers.  That was his only really good year with a bat; 
his other . years were marred by a lack of power and an inability
to draw walks.  Only  of those  PA were bases on balls, which
does not describe a feared hitter.  

On the other hand, he was part of the long line of famous Cleveland B:
Wambsganss, Riggs Stephenson, etc.
