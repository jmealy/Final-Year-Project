#I use xwd/xpr (from the XR dist.) and various programs of the
#ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored X windows. My problem is,

I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the XR version does) louzy
output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me.
Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and
lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel)
image to black and white dots.

So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:
	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to PPM
	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print
	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to PostScript
	lpr			# print

pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care:
If you want your image to be " wide, use:
	pnmtops -noturn -scale  -width 
-noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it
	is high)
-width  Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below)
-scale  Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a
	width less than ", and will thus be printed smaller than " wide.
	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in ", and
	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified
	paper width. 
	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,
	but it will not blow it up automatically.

Hope this helps.
