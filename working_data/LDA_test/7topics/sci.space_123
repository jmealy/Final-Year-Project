     Two GIF images of the ozone maps over the northern and southern
hemispheres are now available at the JPL Info public access site.  These maps
were produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite (UARS), and are courtesy of the Public Information Office
at JPL.  Note that the images are in GIFa format, so make sure your display
software supports this format (as opposed to the older GIFa format).  The
caption files accompanying the images are appended at the end of this message,
as well as being embedded in the images.  The images are available by dialup
modem at + () -, up to  bps, parameters N--, or by using
anonymous ftp to:

        ftp:      pubinfo.jpl.nasa.gov (...)
        user:     anonymous
        cd:       news (will be moved to the images directory in  days)
        files:    ozonea.gif - Northern hemisphere
                  ozoneb.gif - Southern hemisphere

     Also, photographic prints of these images can be ordered from Newell Color
Lab listed below.  Refer to the P number associated with the images when

This graphic depicts chlorine monoxide and ozone over Earth's
northern hemisphere in February  and .  These maps were
produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Upper
Atmosphere Research Satellite.  The chlorine monoxide (ClO) maps
(left) are for a layer about  kilometers (, feet) above
the Earth's surface on February ,  (above) and 
(below).  The ozone maps show the total amount above an altitude
of about  kilometers (, feet) averaged over the period
from February  to March  for the two years.  The Microwave
Limb Sounder, developed and operated by a team at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, is one of several instruments on the
Goddard Space Flight Center's Upper Atmosphere Research
Satellite, launched in September .
