Acorn Replay running on a MHz ARM  processor (the ARM  is about % slower
than the ARM ) does this in software (off a standard CD-ROM).  bit colour at
about the same resolution (so what if the computer only has  bit colour
support, real-time dithering too...). The D/O is supposed to have a couple of
DSPs - the ARM being used for housekeeping.


A MHz ARM xx should clock around  ARM MIPS, say  flat out. Depends
really on the surrounding system and whether you are talking ARMx or ARMxx
(the latter has a cache, and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with
slower memory).

I'll stop saying things there 'cos I'll hopefully be working for ARM after
graduation...

PS Don't pay heed to what reps from Philips say; if the D/O doesn't beat the
   pants off DI then I'll eat this postscript.
