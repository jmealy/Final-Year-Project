I don't know about the dinky little Zephyr's, but the  (now
the ZR) looks alot like my ' Z/ KZ!  The one I drooled over
at Tri-Sports in Topsham, ME was a looker!

Yes, Mercury axed the Zephyr name.  Guess a lot of aging Republicans
wanted a Zephyr and confused the Mercury with the Kawasaki :).  Oh
well, they're better off with the Kawasaki anyways.  Maybe it'll shake the
stick out of their asses and  make Libertarians out of them!

As to the GPz <--> Zephyr, the only GPz I've seen had the ball-buster
gas tank profile, not the smooth saddle - to - gas tank transition.
_Motorcyclist_ claims the Zephyr / ZR is the modernized Z (KZ) from the
seventies.
