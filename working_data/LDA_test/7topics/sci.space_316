this all sounds like that Indecent Proposal movie.  wouldn't there be
a lot of people that would try this with little hope of working just
to get the dough?  if you have a : chance and it costs you $Mil,
then you might pay some stooge a few grand to be your lucky hero.
just send up a few dozen and  is bound to survive enough to make YOU
rich.
