Lou wanted Morris all along.  The idiot.  Giving the man $ million
to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the
safety off.  The only question is how many shots he will get off
before somebody is wise enough to take it away.


I don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth.  The bottom four
teams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had
 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had  wins.

Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than
the Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year
at B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so
far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they
shouldn't win ~ games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and
the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some -
blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of - games too.

*MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win  games, and finish fifth.
But I think third or fourth place is more likely.
