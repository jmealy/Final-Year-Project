I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around  megabytes / sec
for very large data transfers.  (Around  MB.)

I have a Quadra . 
I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at . MB/s.
         (using block-mode transfers)
I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can
         achieve . MB/s.

Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.

It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,
then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (. MB/s then . MB/s
result in an overall . MB/s.  Too slow!)

So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, 

Step :                                Load the st MB from disk to buffer.
Step : Asynch send st MB out card,   Load the nd MB from disk to buffer.
Step : Asynch send nd MB out card,   Load the rd MB from disk to buffer.
        ...
Step n: Asynch send the n- MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.
Step n+: Send the nth MB out card.

Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,
and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')
each of the steps  through n take as long as if the two transfers were
executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.

Why?

Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both
access data at the same time.)
Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use
the same bus to mac RAM?

Is there anything I can do?
