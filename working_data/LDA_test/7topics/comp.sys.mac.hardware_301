I think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive
on its side.  The point is this will only be sure to work on the 'new'
drives, namely / ht LPS drives that have a smaller platter and are also
more stable.
	Why should I take the chance?  Because I've been running a Maxtor / ht
 LPS on both its side and flat for about a year and I've had no
problems with it.  Period.
	Like I always say, NEVER trust the manufacturer.
