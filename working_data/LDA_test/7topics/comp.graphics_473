Hi,

My name is rahul and I am doing MS at USU, Logan
My query is:
	I have a HP workstation: HP Series  with X running on it.
I have a true color - bit color monitor connected to this machine.
Normally I have the capability to display  colors from a max of
. million. Since the monitor is True Color I can see .
million at a time. 
Que: do we have a facility in X(c-function call) that will enable me
to specify any RGB combination and see it on screen? I am using
XStoreColor to set the pallette of a max of  colors.
Que: If not. Is there any way I can display a true color image
on a true color monitor using XLib function calls?

We are generating ray traced images and  colors are indeed a
painful limit. besides I need the facility to display the true color images 
i will be generating on a true color system WITHOUT color 
quantification.
Please, if anyone can help i'd be obliged
