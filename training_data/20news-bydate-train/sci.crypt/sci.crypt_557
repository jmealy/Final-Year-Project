The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack  
against DES is quite feasible now. But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB  
mode where one chooses a random init vector of  bytes. Questions:

 - Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key? Then we have  
a  +  =  bit key.
 
 - If yes: Is anything known about the security of this key scheme? Can we  
break it faster than by exhaustive search through the  bit key space?
