It has been done already!

In the UK the Atari ST box was shipped with K disks in the first few
years and then later K disks. In order to make life less complicated,
many freebie disks on mags were double formatted like this. Side  of the
disk had K on it and could be read  by any ST. It also had a flip-side
program. This would swap the sides around so that side  became side .
