What are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms?
I know DES is  bits ("tripple DES" is  bits) and IDEA is  bits.  Is
there anything made in the US that has  bit keys?  Anything anywhere
that has larger keys?  I've heard that RC can be scaled to arbitrarily
large keys, but is this actually implemented anywhere?

Finally, can anyone even concieve of a time/place where  bit keys aren't
sufficient?  (I certainly can't - even at a trillion keys a second, it
would take about  billion years to search just one billionth of that keys
space.)
