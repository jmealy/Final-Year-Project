Hello.

     I purchased a video card called ET- true color card which
     can provide about K colors. But the question is I can't find
     the corresponding drivers for windows . , I am now using k
     colors driver for win. It works fine , but I think it will be
     better if I use k driver. So, please tell me whether such a
     driver is available !

     Thanks in advance.
