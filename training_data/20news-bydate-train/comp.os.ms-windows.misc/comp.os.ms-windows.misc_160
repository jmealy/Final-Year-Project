Here are some cool -D background patterns I made.

Edit your CONTROL.INI and add the following lines to your [Patterns] section.

Bricks=       
Tile=       
Tile (diagonal)=       
Slats=       

Make sure your desktop color is one of the standard  colors or the
patterns might not work.  I like dark grey the best with these.
