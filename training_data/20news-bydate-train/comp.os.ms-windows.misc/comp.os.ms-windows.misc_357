It sounds like something/one may have set the 's separator to "." in
Contol Panel (under International).  This makes , look like .
and File Manager is chopping off what it thinks is the decimal part of
the file size. ,, becomes .., and again, File Manager is
confused by the decimal points where there should be commas, chopping
off everything to the right of the first period.
