There you go.  COM and COM use the same IRQ, therefore you can't use
a mouse on COM and a modem on COM, or vice versa.  It's a limitation
of DOS.

And in fact Windows will not see a mouse on anything other than COM
or COM.  Accept this fact, and either get a bus mouse, or get a new
computer.


No.  The advice above applies....
