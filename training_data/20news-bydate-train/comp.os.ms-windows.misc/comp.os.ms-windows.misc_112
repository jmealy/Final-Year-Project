As a followup, this is a co-worker's machine.  He has the latest . drivers.
It only happens using the xx driver.  Sometimes it takes a minute
or so for the cursor to wig out, but it eventually does in this mode.  I
susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants.  I excluded
a-cff in the EMM line and in system.ini  The problem persisted.
Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or it's components.
It is a mhz DX/ Eisa bus with an Ultrastore (xx?) controller.  Ah well,
I was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it
before.  Perhaps a call to Gateway is in order, but I do find folks here
usually are far more in the know.
