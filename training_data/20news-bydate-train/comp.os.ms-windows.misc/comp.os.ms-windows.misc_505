Another alternative is to clean the mouse you've got.  Sometimes the
rollers inside the mouse pick up a ball of lint or other debris.  Open the
bottom of the mouse, take out the ball and use some alcohol on a Q-tip to
clean it out.  Inspect the inside for any hairs or fuzz.  I have had my
mouse get real jumpy and cleared up the problem with this procedure.
