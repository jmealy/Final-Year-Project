I have an /A card, and I am using windows in x mode 
	(normal /A font, not small).  In the  enhanced mode
	the DOS window font is too small for my " monitor. Is there a 
	way to spacify the font size for the DOS window? You'll have to 
	excuse me if there is a trivial answer, since I am fairly new to
	MS Windows world.

	Thanks.
