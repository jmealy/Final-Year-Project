Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card!  My  baud
modem was one of the reasons I sought out the Diamond Speedstar X. I get
about  million WinMarks on my - and it just about keeps up with the
modem speed (using procomm plus for windows, too).  He should get over
 million on his machine with the same card.  Anything + should yield
acceptable speed...
