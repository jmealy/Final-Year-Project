When I use the terminal software for Windows such as TERMINAL.EXE or 
Crossttalk, it doesn't use the whole window.  I mean, when the software's
window size is max, it still scrolls around the / of window.  It does not
use whole window.  I set "stty rows ", but still the same. Scrolls at /
from the top of the windows.  Could anyone tell me how to setup these software
to use whole window?
