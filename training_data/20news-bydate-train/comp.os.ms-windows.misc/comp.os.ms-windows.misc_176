I am using WFW .c with a Canon BJe. The printer driver is that 
which comes with Windows .. Unfortatunately, I am having a problem with 
printing page numbers on the bottom of the page. I can print page number 
on the top of the page, but not on the bottom. Has anybody had a similar 
problem and/or does anybody have a solution for such a problem.

Thanks
