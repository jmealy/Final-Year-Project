: The key issue that I bought my BJ- on was ink drying speed.  You really 
: have to try awful hard to get the BJ- ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need 
: - seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your 
: pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not 
: toner.  But that should go without saying.
