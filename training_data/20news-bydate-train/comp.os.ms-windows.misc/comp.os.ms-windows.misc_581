I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth  Video card
and received the wrong drivers.  Does anyone know where
I can ftp the windows video drivers for the Stealth .
I tried the drivers at cica and they don't work.
The right drivers are on the Diamond BBS but the file is almost
 meg and it would take a while to download them
at  baud.  Any information would be appreciated.  Please
contact me at doug@sun.sws.uiuc.edu

Thank you
