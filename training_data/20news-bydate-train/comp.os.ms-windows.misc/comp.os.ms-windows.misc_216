I am looking for a WIN driver (or set) for my Diamond 
Speedstar MB video card. Does anybody know of an archive
site that has these? I looked at CICA and it had drivers for
the Stealth card and for Generic ET cards but not one 
specifically for the Speedstar. Is there one? Or has Diamond
dropped the Speedstar out of the driver development loop.

Thanks for any info,

Rob
