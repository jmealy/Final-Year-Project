Have you tried setting FILES in your config.sys file to a fairly high
number? (I've got mine set to ; I've seen numbers from  to  
recommended). Also check your STACKS statement, STACKS=, is a good
starting point. Try increasing it if it's already set there (such as
to STACKS=,, etc.). Both STACKS and FILES have been identified as
_one_ cause of frequent Win. crashes.
