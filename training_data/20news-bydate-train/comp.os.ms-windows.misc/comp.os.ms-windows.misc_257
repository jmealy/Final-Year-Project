Hi,

I have a /MHz SYS based PC with M RAM and a problem.

What is the best way to configure high memory with QEMM/MAX ??
I have a SPEEDSTAR X video card and use Hyperdisk disk cache
software. The problem is running Windows . in Enhanced mode and
having any high memory to load stuff high?

Note :
I tried, as recommended to exclude the region A-CFF but Windows
insists on starting in Standard mode.

Any suggestions?
