Try WorkShift by Karl Thoreddson. The latest version is . (or later?) but
the following is at Cica in the Desktop directory.
WRKSFT ZIP : WorkShift Graphical Virtual Desktop (ver .)

Or email Karl and ask him to put version . up

I was Beta tester for WorkShift and must say it is very good
(I gain nothing from saying that).
It'll even remember your WorkShifts (WorkSpaces as you said) between
Windows sessions.
