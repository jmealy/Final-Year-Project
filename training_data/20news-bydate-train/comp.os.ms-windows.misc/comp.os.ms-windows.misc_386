For Logitech rodents use  the lmouse driver that comes with windows....
also you need to be using a video driver that supports use of the mouse,
both the VGA and SUPERVGA that come with Windows . will support it. 
both of these are  color drivers, if you're lucky the manufacturer of
your video card might have a driver that is compatable and will support a
mouse.
