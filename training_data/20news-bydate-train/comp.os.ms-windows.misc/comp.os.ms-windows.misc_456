Hello,

	Who can tell me   Where can I find the PD or ShareWare   
Which can CAPTURE windows .'s output of printer mananger?

	I want to capture the output of HP Laser Jet III.

	Though the PostScript can setup to print to file,but HP can't.

	I try DOS's redirect program,but they can't work in Windows .

		Thankx for any help....
