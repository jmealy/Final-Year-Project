I just got Mathcad ., and the manual is not clear on the matter.  On page :

	:
	:

* At least  megabytes of memory.  All memory about K should be configured
  as XMS.

	:
	:
* At least  megabytes of virtual memory....

Common sense suggests that you should be able to run it (+= < ) but the
new Mathcad is kinda kooky, and thus is not subject to the laws of common
sense...
