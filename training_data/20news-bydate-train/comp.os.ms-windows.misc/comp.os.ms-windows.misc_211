I've been using MS Access (still available from some stores for $.)
and I am quite pleased with it.  It's relatively easy to learn, very easy
to use and somewhat easy to program.  I highly recomend it, particularly
at $.!  I have not used Paradox for Windows, but I don't expect it to
be $. better than Access (IMHO).
