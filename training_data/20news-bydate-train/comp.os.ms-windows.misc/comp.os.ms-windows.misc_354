about .Kbyte without Novell . support.

No.

No.
Nearly all.

We run mixed WNT beta and WWG, no problem apart from printer sharing( beta problem)

We had problems with mouse drivers using WWG where Windows . didn't, seems to be 
more critical about it. It was actualy a port problem with the network card running on xe, we changed it to x, now everything is allright, I think it has to do with the AMI Bios as well.
