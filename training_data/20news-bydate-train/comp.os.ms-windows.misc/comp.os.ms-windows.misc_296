Preface: I am a novice user at best to the Windows environment.

I am trying to execute a MS C++ . executable program which accesses a Btrieve
database to build an ASCII file.  

When I execute it under windows the screen goes blank and my PC locks up.  The only
way for me to return is to reset the machine.

Does anyone have any insight on what I may have to do in order for the program to
correctly under windows?  (By the way it runs fine in DOS .)

System:  Gateway /DX 
	 ATI Graphics Ultra Card x

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
