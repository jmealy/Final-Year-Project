Hi there,

With a Megs of RAM, is there a need to run/load Smartdrv for
Windows .?  If yes, can I run/load Ramdrive without Smartdrv?
If I need both Ramdrive & Smartdrv, is the following Config.Sys
settings OK:  ...SMARTDRV.SYS  
              ...RAMDRIVE.SYS  /E

Thanks in advance for e-mail reply.
