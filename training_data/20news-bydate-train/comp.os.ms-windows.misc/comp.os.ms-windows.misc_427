Just got a ssX based on its good ratings, but am a little
under-impressed.  First, is it's performance in . mill. supposed
to be comparable to a Trident  (or other unaccelerated VGA)?  I 
came up with only OK performance on WinSpeed.  In , it was between
good and great.  Second, does anyone know where to get that JPG viewer
"for the SSX".  I saw it on cica or something.  Does it work better.

Thanks for any help.

Greg
