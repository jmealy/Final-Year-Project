Does anyone have the documentation for the MS Mouse Driver .?  I got it when  
I got Windows ., but my Windows manual does not come with the documentation.   
In particular I need to know how to turn it off, and how to speed it up  
outside windows.  The greater sensitivity is needed so I can play various  
games, esp X-wing :)
