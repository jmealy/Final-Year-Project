Well, some quick math on my part shows that an .MHz bus,  bits
wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide .M
bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes  clock cycles to
perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to .MB/s,
which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I
believe a two-clock transfer is possible ( wait states).
