Hi,

I am going through a box of old IBM card and came across one called a 

Rapid Technology SQUEEZE card.  It is dated  and has a mhz crystal on
it and a big chip that has 'C-Cube' on it.

No connectors to the outside, but a ribbon-type -pin connector on the board.

It is a -bit board.

Any ideas what it is?


Phil
