Hello,

I am looking for a PC card with the following features:

  - Controller for IDE(AT-Bus)-HardDiskDrive
  - Controller for  FloppyDiskDrives
  - Standard(KB) VGA Graphics  INCLUDING FEATURE CONNECTOR (important!)
                                  ===========================

There *are* some manufacturors/distributors of this kind of card, but I have
not found them yet.

If you can help me, please mail to:  ICH@DJUKFA
