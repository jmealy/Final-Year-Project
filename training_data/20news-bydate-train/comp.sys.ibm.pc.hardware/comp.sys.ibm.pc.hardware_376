I recently decided to try using emm.exe for a memory manager and when I
tried to print to my printer in lpt from word I wouldn't work.  It would
send the linefeeds for the top margin and then the printer READY light would
go off and stop working.  I disabled emm.exe and the problem went away.
I would like to continue using emm.exe if possible.  I would greatly    
appreciate any comments or suggestions!!  please send them to arthur@u.washingt,
