I have a Sony S " monitor and I don't see any lines across
the screen and am only using the non interlaced mode.
But because of the hor. lines and poping that I do see and hear
when I am usinf xx and xx modes and switch back
to anything of less. I would not buy another Sony at what ever price.
Oh ya this is I guess a " viewing area. It don't impress me one bit!   Sam
