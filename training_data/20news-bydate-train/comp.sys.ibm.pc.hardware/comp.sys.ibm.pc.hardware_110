Hi,

I would like to hear the net.wisdom and net.opinions on IDE Controllers.
I would liek to get a IDE controller card for my VLB DX  Motherboard.
What are good options for this (preferably under $). It MUST also work
under OS/ and be compatible with Stacker (and other Disk Compression S/W).

Please advise .....
