I purchased a Super Voyager VLB Mhz board from Washburn & Company a month ago.
I don't have the mailing address-- Clyde Washburn advertises regularly in PC Week.  He can also be reached via CompuServe.    The phone number is    
---.

I think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributers,plus I liked  the fact he's a EE that knows what he's talking about
concerning hardware, and he can be easily reached via CompuServe for non  
critcle questions, and is very informative to his customers over the phone.
