I'm looking into getting an external, reasonably fast (< ms avg access time)
Multispin CD-ROM drive that supports "Photo CD Multi Session", has audio
output, and SCSI interface for connection to the PAS SCSI port. Does anyone
have any comments/experiences/warnings/recommendations they'd like to share
concerning the Texel DM- and/or Toshiba TXM-E and/or others. THANKS!
