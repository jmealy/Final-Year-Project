Hello, 
I have a Hayes  moden with no cables or manuals.  The
modem requires a source of V AC, but I do not know how
to connect the power source to the  pin connector.  I know
that the top pin is the ground, so I would guess that the other
two are the AC pins, right?  If you have any hints, please
E-Mail me, I really need help...  Thanks!!!  Duc N.
