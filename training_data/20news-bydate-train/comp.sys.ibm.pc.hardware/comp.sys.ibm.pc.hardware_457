I have a / motherboard with AMI BIOS.
I haven't located the little motherboard manual yet,
and suddenly it's giving me  beeps when I turn the power on.
It was working fine this morning,
then gave all kinds of problems, in Windows and outside it.
After multiple reboots, now it only gives  beeps and sits there?
