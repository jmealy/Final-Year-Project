We are trying to connect an Olivetti XM " floppy drive as the second
drive on a Panasonic  machine.  It seems to sort of talk to it (gets it
spinning and stepping) but gives a "Disk not ready" error.

There are two jumpers (which seem to work best open), a  position DIP
switch, and a  position DIP switch.  We don't know how to set the DIP
switches and think that may be the problem.

Any information, or advice (other than "junk the stupid thing" :) would be
most appreciated, thanks.  (email reply preferred).
