Hi,

I just disassembled my old XT and get  disk drives - M hard drive and a 
K floppy drive.  My questions are:

 -can I use these  drives as drives D & E on my SX ?  This SX
  currently has M hard drive, .M & .M floppy drives.

 -if I can, what s/w or h/w do I need ?

 Please send your advice/comments to aovai@qube.ocunix.on.ca

 Thanks a lot,

 AV
