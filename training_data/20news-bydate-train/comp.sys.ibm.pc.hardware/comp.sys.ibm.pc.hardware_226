I am using a  IBM monitor (" greysale) with a Trident (MB) card.

The screen looks great (Windows) at x but total shit at x.
There are lots of lines and the image is sorta blurry.

Is there anything I can do.  Do you think it is the monitor?  I know
that it is Interlaced at that res but still.

thanks for the help
