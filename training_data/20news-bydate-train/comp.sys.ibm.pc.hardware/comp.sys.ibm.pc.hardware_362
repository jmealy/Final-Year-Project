I am looking for a company that can make custom keys.  For instance we need
a key that says HELP, MAIN MENU, etc which we are going to use instead of
F,F, F etc... Can anyone point me to a company that does this.  Also 
do you have to have a special keyboard, or can I just pop off the old keys
and pop in the new ones...
