While rummaging through a box of old PC () parts, I found a half-size
board that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems and
has a copyright date of  on it.  The board provides a male -pin connector
and has  jumpers of  pins each, two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PC
and ran Advanced diagnostics several times, changing the jumper positions each
time, but the system did not recognise a comm port.

Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it?
I could use another comm port if it's free.
