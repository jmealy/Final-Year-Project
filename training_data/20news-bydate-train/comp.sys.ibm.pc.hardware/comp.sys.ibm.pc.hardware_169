I have a Maxtor MB on an ISA IDE controller, although my machine is
DX/ VLB. I has the save transfer rate of . MB/s regardless of
the variations of the ISA bus speed. I tested it with speed between
.MHz and .MHz. Not _any_ difference. The problem is not the
interface between the controller and the memory.

My advice: Buy Megs of RAM, save $ and enjoy performance.
