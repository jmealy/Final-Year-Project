I have been unable to get COM  to work - diagnostic programs such as msd show
nothing installed.  I think the software options are OK - is there a known
hardware conflict and/or workaround for this problemand CD ROM
System is a GK DX/ tower with ATI video card
Ports are set as follows 
  On board COMa = COM IRQ to external device
  Internal modem = COM  IRQ
  DFIO port card primary port = COM  IRQ  mouse
  On board COM B = COM  IRQ   <--- DOES NOT WORK
I have run this from a boot disk with only command.com to eliminate softwar
