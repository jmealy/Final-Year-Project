. Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different
   TSR programs.

. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.

. Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is x faster.

. You can disable disconnect and get some kB/s but just to loose the mouse
   or other int`s when diskaccesing.

(I get .MB/s with DX LB and SCSI LB and Maxtor LXTSY - Coretest)
