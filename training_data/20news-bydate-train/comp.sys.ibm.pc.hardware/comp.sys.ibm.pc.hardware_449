I have just a few quick questions.  Does anyone here have a  DLC
system? (a Cyrix  DX)  Any problems with it?  
Second, how much should a Cyric DLC- motherboard (with
no RAM) run me?  
rd...Should a total amatuer (like myslef) be able to perform
a motherboard swap without the aid of a technician, or is it
beyond hope?
th...I hear that some (if not all) hard drives may require reformatting
if you switch them to another computer (or motherboard as the case may
be).  Is there any truth to this?
