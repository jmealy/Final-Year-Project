I own an  K clone which does all I want except run  game I want
to buy.  The game says it requires a  with K.  Game tech. support
says game will run on  but uses a some digitized graphics which would
make it run really *slow* (it's a card game - Hoyles Classic Card Games,
digitized graphics are photos artwork of game fictional card players).

What can I do to speed up how this game would run, short of an 
motherboard upgrade.  Co-processor?  Accelerator card mimicking ?
My  can run at  Mhz.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
