Hi,
  I am looking to buy an accelerated video card for my  DX  with	
ISA bus.  I have a " SVGA NI monitor.  I'm currently running
DOS . and windows ., although I'm considering OS/ in the	
future.  Can anyone make a suggestion for a video card that would
suit my needs?  How is Diamond speedstar? Stealth? Etc....
				Thanks.
