Hi!

   I'm busy resurrecting some old machines (hey, they're cheap and they
work :)) and would be grateful for any help with the following card -

Magitronic - full length  bit memory only card.
Has room for  rows of K dips for a total of MB RAM.
Has an  position dip switch on it, presumably for addressing.

Does any kind soul out there have any docs or drivers for this beast?
I'd be disgustingly grateful.

                            Thanks,
                                    Lee.
