Cyrix have released a  pin-conpatible  clone. Designed to upgrade
old  & MHz 's the chips are also clockdoubling. Thus a MHz 
can be transformed into a MHz , with a single chip upgrade.

Unfortunately in Australia the DRu sells for $A (MHz) and $A
(MHz), about .x the price of a dx motherboard with two vlb slots!!!

How much do these thing cost in the States?
How well do they work?

Thanks for any info,
