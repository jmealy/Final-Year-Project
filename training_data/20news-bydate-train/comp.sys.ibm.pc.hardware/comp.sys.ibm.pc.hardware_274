I have one and it is my favorite CD-ROM drive so far.  I also have 
a NEC- and have had experience with several other drives (Various 
Phillips drives)

	The  is faster than the NEC, I like its door better (the NEC 
needs  hands), the XA handling (The NEC needs to be re-booted to go from 
XA to ROM while the  does it on the fly), All in all I am seriously 
considering replacing my NEC with another Toshiba.
