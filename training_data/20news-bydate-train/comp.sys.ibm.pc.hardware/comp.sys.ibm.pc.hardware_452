Most importantly, which Winbench version are you using?  On my local bus ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro, I've gotten various Winbench scores from . million to
 million winmarks, depending on the version.  Winbench . gives the most
optimistic scores, . gives the least.  A winmark rating is meaningless
without a corresponding version number.
