I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives
usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your SX has IDE drives. The
two are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be
able to use the drive *with its controller* in your SX. You should be
able to plug your K drive into your existing SX controller (I
think). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the
XT.
