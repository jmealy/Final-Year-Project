I have been able to successfully use both  and  bit color modes on my
Gateway system, although my setup is less complicated than yours.  It sounds as
if you may have a hardware conflict or problem.  Is your memory aperture above
M?  I have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that SCSI card with a
variety of systems.  Call up Gateway and give them hell until they help you
fix it.
