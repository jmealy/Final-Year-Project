Oh yeah! I just got my new Eizo Flexscan yesterday (to replace my old ), and
I tried it with x. This mode is just great! I can get four perfectly readable
command windows on the screen! And if I need more colors, I can go back to x
or even x.
One thing I am wondering though: Why isn't there a MONxxxx.DGS file which contains
ALL the resolutions up to x? Now I have to change the XGASETUP.PRO every
time I want to switch, instead of simply going through the system settings of OS/.
