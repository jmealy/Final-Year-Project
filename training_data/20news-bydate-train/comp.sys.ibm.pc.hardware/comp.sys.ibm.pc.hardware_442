I have a Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo  tape backup unit in my Gateway
/V Tower system. I have found the supplied backup capability to be 
fairly unreliable. In approx  cases out of , I have had the backup fail
at one point or another, often hanging in the middle of writing the tape.
Seek errors, drive communication errors seem to be most common. I use the
DOS backup software from Colorado Memory Systems. Should I return the drive,
get some better backup software, reformat the tapes (am using CMS tapes)?
Any hints would be appreciated - this stuff is to time-consuming to do over
and over again until it cooperates...
