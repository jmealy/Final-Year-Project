I received a Kaypro i computer (DOS) without a manual that 
describes the jumpers on the motherboard.  It came with
KB and I up'd it to MB.  But the computer or setup does not
recognize the extra K. 

Does anyone know if this computer is capable of greater than K
on the main board and what jumpers are required to expand it to MB?

Some specs:
	Kaypro main board assy number -
	Phoenix BIOS v.
