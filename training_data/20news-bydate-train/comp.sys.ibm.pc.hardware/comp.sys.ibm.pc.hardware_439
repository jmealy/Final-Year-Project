Could someone please give me some info regarding the USR Sportsters that have
recently dropped below $? I was going to buy a used Courier vbis external
without fax for $ but now I see the Sportster with Fax is selling below
$ brand new! Are these good modems? What warranty do they carry?

Any info very much appreciated.
