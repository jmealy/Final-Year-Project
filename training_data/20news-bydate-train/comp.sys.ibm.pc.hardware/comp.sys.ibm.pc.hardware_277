Once in a while you have to put in a good word for something that works
well.  I have had no problems with my Toshiba .  It works very well with
DOS and OS/.  For OS/, you don't need to load any special drivers.  The
installation will detect that it is a Toshiba drive and you are done.

BTW, it's also very fast!
