Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with MB/s and Hard drives START
at MB I have NO idea.
For the Mac I have the following {These are ALL external}
 MB $ {$/MB}
 MB $ {$./MB}
 MB $ {$./MB}
MB $-$ {$.-$./MB
MB $-${$.-$./MB}
MB $-$ {$.-$./MB}
MB $-$ ($.-$./MB}
etc

So scsi-/SCSI- for the Mac goes down in price/MB as hard drive size goes
up {and I assume the same for the PC world.}
