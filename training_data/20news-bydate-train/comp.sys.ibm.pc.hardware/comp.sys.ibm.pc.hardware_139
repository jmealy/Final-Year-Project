I'm using inth to read my joystick, and it is hideously slow.  Something
like % of my CPU time is being spent reading the joystick, and this
is in a program that does nothing but printf() and JoyRead().

The problem is that a lot of programs trap inth ( like SMARTDRV ) and
so it is a slow as hell interface.  Can I read the joystick port in
a reasonably safe fashion via polling?  And that isn't platform or
clockspeed specific?

Thanks,
