Someone Else, could you please comment on that. I have just bought
a Twincom .DFi, which has a Rockwell chipset. It wasn't cheap
so I would like to hear of problems I'm likely to run into.


Phew, I was lucky! The Twincom internal version has a A and one
of the Rockwell chips is marked RCDP.

But still I would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware
problems.
