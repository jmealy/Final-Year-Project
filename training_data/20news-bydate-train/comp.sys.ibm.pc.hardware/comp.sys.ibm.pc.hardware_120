XGA or XGA-?  For the original XGA you just need something that can do
x at /Hz interlaced (just tell them " compatible" and they
should get the idea).  For the XGA-, get what you like.  I prefer multi-
syncs like the IBM , the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor like
my home Viewsonic .  I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them
in modes like xxk colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like
xx.
