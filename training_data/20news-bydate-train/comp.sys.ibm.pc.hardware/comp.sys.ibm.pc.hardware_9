I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with
my Gateway  -DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB.  
When I have my computer in any resolution other than x, everything is
fine, but whenever I use it in x (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen 
gets about  / inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen
there is about a /" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes
everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can
manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just
shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't 
been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and
both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried
to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of
days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than  weeks
before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...
So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what
to do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'm
not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.
