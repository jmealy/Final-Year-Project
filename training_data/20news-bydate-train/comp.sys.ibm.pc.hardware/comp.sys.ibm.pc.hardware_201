While playing around with my Gateway  local-bus machine last
night, it became apparent that Windows . didn't give the option
for -bit access for virtual memory.

I am using a permanent swap file, and the disk drive is on the local
bus interface.

Is this expected, or should I be investigating further why no -bit
option appears?

Thanks for any help.
