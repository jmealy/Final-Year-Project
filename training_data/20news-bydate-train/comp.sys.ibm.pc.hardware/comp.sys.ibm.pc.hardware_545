Have you checked: / The setting of drive A: to . M floppy.
						/ The setting of drive B: to . M foppy.
						/ The cable connecting the two drives to
						the controller card (I can't remember which
						two wires are swapped, but they determine
						which is drive A: & b:).

I hope this is of some help :-)
