Hi,

I'm looking to buy a " monitor soon, and it seems that I can't decide what
monitor I should buy. I have a MAG S (this is a . dpi version and it using
a TRINITON tube) and a NANAO i in mind.

Does anyone know of any specification or problems these monitor have?

Actually, any related opinions at buying a " monitor will be welcomed.


 Thanks in advance,
