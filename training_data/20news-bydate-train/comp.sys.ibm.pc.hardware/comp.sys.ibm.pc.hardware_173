hi folks
i have  hd first is an seagate mb
the second a cdc mb (with a future domain no ram)
i'd like to change my  controller ide & scsi and buy
a new one with ram (at least mb) that could controll 
all of them
any companies?
how many $?
and is it possible via hw or via sw select how divide
the ram cache for  hd? (for example using dos that is 
about all on one hd i'd like to reserve ram cache just to it)
