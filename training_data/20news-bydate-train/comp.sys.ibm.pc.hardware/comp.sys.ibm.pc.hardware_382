I would realy like to hear from someone that has one of these NANAO Ti
monitors that is driving it with a Diamond SpeedStar x. With the x
set up to run at its . khz .hz output mode, and realy driving the
hell out of the monitor. Just woundering if the NANAO Ti would fall
apart with poor low capabilities like my () Sony s did with the x
driving their balls off...Sam
