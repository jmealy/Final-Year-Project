The best group to keep you informed is the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation
of America.  I do not know if the UK has a similar organization.  The
address of
the CCFA is 

CCFA
 Park Avenue South
th Floor
New York, NY  -
USA

They have a lot of information available and have a number of newsletters.
 
Good Luck.
