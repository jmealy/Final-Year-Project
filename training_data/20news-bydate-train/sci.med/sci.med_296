: "% of diseases" is not the same thing as "% of patients".

   In a world with one curable disease that strikes  people, and nine
   incurable diseases which strikes one person each, medical science will cure
   % of the patients and report that % of diseases have no therapy.

: A disease would be counted among the % untreatable if nothing better than
   a placebo were known.  Of course MDs are ethically bound to not knowingly
   dispense placebos...
