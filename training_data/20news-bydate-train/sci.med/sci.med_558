Hi...

I need information on scaring. Particularly as a result of grazing the skin
I really wanted to know of 

	. would a scar occur as a result of grazing
	. if yes, then would it disappear?
	. how long does a graze take to heal?
	. will hair grow on it once it has healed?
	. what is 'scar tissue'?
	. should antiseptic cream be applied to it regularly?
	. is it better to keep it exposed and let fresh air at it?

Please help - any info - no matter how small will be appreciated greatly.
