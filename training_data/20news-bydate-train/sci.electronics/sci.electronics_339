-| I just installed a Motorola XCRC FPU in an Amiga A board ( MHz
-|  +  with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously
-| a MCRC was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the
-| systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for
-| the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MCRC the system works
-| fine, but with the XC even at  MHz it does not work.  The designer
-| of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe ( Ohm)
-| might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some
-| suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications
-| problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?
-| Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XCRC.  I thought
-| that the RC were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). 
-| Are there any MCRC?
-| 
-| Thanks

             Have you changed the crystal that clocks for the FPU. If you
   haven't then it won't work.
