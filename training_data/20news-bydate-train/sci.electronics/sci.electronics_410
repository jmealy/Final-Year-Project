Could someone please tell me if a / decoder is the same as a  to 
demultiplexer. I know how to link  of these to get an  output circuit,
but how do I link  of these to make a / multiplexer. Sorry if this
seems like a lame question, but I'm only a newbie to electronics, and I
have to do this circuit. Please make any mail as droolproof as possible.
