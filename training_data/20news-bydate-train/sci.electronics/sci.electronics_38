What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair,
Space Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support -- (at least
that's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V Interface
Guide. It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes
for the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking
the player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired
controller.
