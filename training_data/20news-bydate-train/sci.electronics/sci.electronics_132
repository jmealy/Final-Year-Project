. Can low Voltage lights be controlled with an X  module by putting it 
before the transformer? It seems to work, even the dimmer works. Not very 
reliable. Will it damage the module? Can it be done reliably?

. I put a motion switch (Heath) to a low voltage light, it worked but now it is
broken, too much current? How can I get arround that? 
  
. How can I increase the intensity of a light using the X PC computer
interface without having it go % on first and then down. I am doing
my own programing, not the X program.
