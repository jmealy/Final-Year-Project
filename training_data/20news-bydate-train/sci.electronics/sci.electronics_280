Yes.

I use HC and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it 
works fine. In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it 
is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given 
some pretty fast edges. HC is spec'd at something like -dB @ MHz into 
 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more 
resistive.

Plain  series are not so good at handling v logic.

Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.
