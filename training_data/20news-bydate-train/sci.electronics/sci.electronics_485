Are you sure that he needs a two way converter? If he wants only
RS->TTL I would suggest the MC, its very cheap (. DM in
Germany). This chip needs only +V. The MC TTL->RS-Converter
uses +V and -V.

BTW... The MAX and compatibles seem to be expensive in the USA...
I paid . DM for a ITS (made by Harris), its absolutely
compatible with the MAX or the ICL.
