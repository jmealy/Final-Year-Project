I keep finding these programmers in local junk shops. This may
mean that they are indeed junk - but i'd like to hear from anyone 
else that may have met up with them. The basic device is a
"Data I/O A universal programmer", and the usual pod is a 
"LogicPak A-Vo" with a "A-" programming tester/
adapter. I'd really like to hear from anyone who knows whether
these monsters are worth bothering with. All i want to do is blast
PALCEVs. - Ideas, folks
Mike.
