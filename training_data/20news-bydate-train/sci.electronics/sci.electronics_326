: As the subject says - Can I use a  for digital signals?  I don't see
: why it couldn't handle digital signals, but I could be wrong.  Anyone have
: any advice?  Thanks.

The switches have a non-negligable on resistance (up to k ohm when
powered by  volts) and a maximum current and a Maximum Static
Voltage Across Switch.  Not a good bet for TTL.  Should work for
CMOS, but slow things down a bit.  There are HC versions that
have better specs. but lower max voltage.
