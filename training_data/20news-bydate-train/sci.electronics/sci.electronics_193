I was wondering if anyone out there in net-land knew of a SIMPLE
way to make a -band equalizer (single channel).  I need it to accept
LINE inputs (tape deck, CD player, etc.) and output to the same! So
input impedance should equal output impedance.  Also, since I am driving
a line, I would need  volt p-p output.  Final requirement is that I
can either:
	      . Control it digitally
			OR
	      . Control it easily, or with few resistors
