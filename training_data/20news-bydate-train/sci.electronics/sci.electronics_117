My impression -- it's not an area I've played with much -- is that the
much-beloved NE is basically obsolete.  If you want to detect a kHz
tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your
input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end.  The NE was
what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays
they're easy, and the results are better.
