I missed the first part of this thread; are you switching line level or
speaker level audio?
If line level, there's a single chip x *stereo* audio switch available
that switches  two-channel inputs into  two-channel output, and also
has a mute function, all controllable with ttl inputs.  LM, I think?

If speaker level, never mind.  :(
