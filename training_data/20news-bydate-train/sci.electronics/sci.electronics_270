Intel also makes some neat memory and peripheral chips:

Old technology (early 's)  
  ram plus IO (slow ram as I recall)
  eprom plus IO (expensive and slow)


Intel does make Eproms with built in address latches.
I fear that you would need a very flexible and up-to-date eprom
programmer to write to them.

give them a call.  I am not able to locate their memory products book
yet.



Sigh...  Now, who borrowed it...
