Can somebody please help me with information about an
American Magnetics Corporation Magstripe Card Reader that
I recently bought locally from a surplus dealer.

On the rear it has the following information:

	American Magnetics Corporation
	Carson, CA, USA
	Magstripe Card Reader
	Model ,
	P/N  - 

It is fitted with a cable with a RS Cannon -pin connector on
the end and has a separate power connector like the once used with
wall chargers.
