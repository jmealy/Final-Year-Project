We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSDxx series. They have
_mega_ address decoding logic on them, various ROM sizes (upto Mbit),
various RAM sizes (upto  K), and  I/O ports which can be chip select
lines, I/O or the buffered address lines.

Cute chip,  pin PLCC package.

Second sourcing may be a problem though :-(
