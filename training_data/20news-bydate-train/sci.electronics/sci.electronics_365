It appears as if the problem is related to the /'s need for very fast
(and clean) signal transitions.  I got some email (Vielen Dank, Thomas) stating
that Motorola provides a solution for this problem in their  manual.  
Since my manual () predates the  MHz /s I couldn't find it.
Could someone please email me the specifics?
		Thanks
