I was wondering if anyone knows of a chip that that is similar to
the internal timer  on the Intel C?  I want a timer that has
a Maxcount A and B and the output should the same as Intel's timer.  I called
Intel and they told me that they don't make such a chip.  Any suggestions
are welcome.  Thanks in advance.
