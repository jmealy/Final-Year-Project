I have a spare Fluke A.  This is a true RMS digital meter with
. digit display.  It's in "average" condition (been used) but 
works fine - which is what Fluke's are all about.   BTW - according
to the fellow who designed these meters, they can be converted to A
function by clipping a jumper, and adding the  extra switches..
Like I said $ seems fair - these sell for $+ new.
