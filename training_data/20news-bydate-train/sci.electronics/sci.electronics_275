My Beckman died a few days ago, thanks do about a  or  foot drop onto a
lab table.  !@#!@$#!@$@#$  Probably not indicative of anything, but I've
already filled out the requisition for a Fluke . :-)

Oh yeah, and sometimes our measurements here do count.  Not often, but often
enough that I want at least _one_ good meter!
