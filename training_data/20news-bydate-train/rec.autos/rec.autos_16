This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT  or  times in my
 i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!)
with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put  Noika NRs on in Dec. and have been 
sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through
 -  inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed
(front wheel drive included).

Concentrate more on "where the rubber meets the road" rather than driveability of cars
in snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will perform
adequately in less than ideal conditions.

An aside: 
I can't praise Noika NR snows enough. Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have ever
driven on. If you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of these
next winter.
