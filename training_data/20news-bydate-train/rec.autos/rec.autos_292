Sure, but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better
than most of the roads here. A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at  will kill you at . Don't get me wrong, I love to
drive quickly and they say my Probe will do , but that's  more
than I've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece
of road hereabouts.
