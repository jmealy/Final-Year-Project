FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

On the other hand, if it can be proven, it's possible the changed 
terms could be thrown out.  The question will be whether the 
agreement contains a merger clause.  See UCC @ - (parol 
evidence).  If we're talking about warranties, then, of course, 
UCC @ - should be looked at.

But we have so little information that none of us can say anything 
conclusive.
