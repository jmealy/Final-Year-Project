Hi Folks,

I recently bought a  Mercury Capri (my first car ever!).
I have noticed a few problems with the car :

	. It gives very low gas mileage (something like
            miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of
           gas-mileage figures like  miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).

	. When I start the car, it goes into high idling (something
           like  (or is it  ?) rpm. After driving  or  miles, 
           it comes down to  (or ?) rpm. 

I would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix these
problems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has
done about , miles). Someone suggested that I change/rebuild/
recondition the carburettor. I am not prepared to do it
unless I am sure it will fix the problem. And yes, I got the
car tuned-up recently (within the last  miles or so).

Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Please respond
by email since I don't scan this newsgroup regularly.

Thanks.

Regards,
