Please satisfy my curiosity. I'm interested in finding out who is using the
e-mail system. Please do not flood me with mail after April st. Thanks!
Maria Alice Ruth  mao@psuvm.bitnet or @psuvm.psu.edu

. Are you male or female?

. How long have you been using the e-mail system?

. How do you have access (at work, at school, etc)?

. Who taught you how to use the system? Is that person male or female?

. Have you helped anyone to learn the system? Was that person(s) male or
   female?

. Which net did you find my questions on?

. Which other nets are you interested in?
