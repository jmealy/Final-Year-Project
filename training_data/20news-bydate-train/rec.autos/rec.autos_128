  The funny thing about the digital dash ( T-bird) with the mph speedo 
limit was that if you pressed the button to convert to kilometers it would 
read all the way up to kph.  At this point the stock anemic  would get 
short of breath.  This of course was equivalent to about mph (hehe).I bet 
I really coulda confused this thing if I'd toyed with the engine and rolled
the stupid thing (the digits were limited to ). 

  I've gotta agree with ya on the analog clock w/digital dash though.  My
girlfriend had a ' TurboCoupe with a digital clock and analog gauges/radio.
Go figure...

  I had a great feature on my T-bird....  I could pull the key out and 
leave the ignition on.  This scared the hell out of me the first time it
happened but I kinda grew to like it.  Musta been a bad key copy or 
something.
