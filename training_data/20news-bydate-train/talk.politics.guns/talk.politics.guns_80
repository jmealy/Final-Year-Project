Which crap, the ridiculous assertions that Uzis are mowing down cops
right and left? The assertions that dialing  should be the proper
and only option available to the law-abiding citizens?

A factoid:

 cops were killed in the whole country last year. This is down from
around  in the early 's. Wow, a real explosion in cop killings
there eh?  :-)
