According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any
utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS may be worth it. 

For people who have DOS, and some sort of utility, DOS doesn't offer
much. You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create, however. :-)
