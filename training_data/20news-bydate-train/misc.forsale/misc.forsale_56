Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,
the TCD-D which is smaller and less expensive than the D.  Also, the D
has a coaxial jack which the D lacks.  Oh, the D has always been
available through mail-order houses for less than $ dollars new... with
the new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D will be selling for 
even less.
