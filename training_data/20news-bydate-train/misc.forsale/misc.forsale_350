Subject: . External FD for PS/ (extremely cheap)

I have a brand new . external floppy drive for PS/, still in the box.
I will sell it for $ + shipping/firm, which is half of the market price
(check page  of Computer Shopper, Apr- issue, the price is $ there).

Please let me know if you are interested.
