IRWIN suggests the use of pre-formatted tapes for their tape drives, as
you often can't successfully format a tape and need  bulk-erase it before
you can format it again. Anyway, I have some new, preformatted tapes for
IRWIN  tape drives. 
IRWIN accuTRAK series -MB, $/ea. New never used.
M DC, RHOMAT Format.  $/ea. Wraped.

Email if interested.
