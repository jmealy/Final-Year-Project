I am looking to sell my ICOM IC-AT and extras.  I have the  
following:
CM- Battery
HS- Headset
HS-SA VOX unit
Cigarette Adapter
Leather Case
BC-V Wall Charger
IC-BP Battery		Also have one that needs a new cell (i think,  
its been a while)

It is in good condition, has a scratch on the front that is not  
visible when in the leather case.

If you are interested, make me an offer.
