Looking for an amateur radio operator that needs a variable power linear
amplifier for -MHz.  Looks and works like new.  Runs off v for mobile
use.  Input: - watts  Output: ~ watts AM, ~ watts PEP SSB.
I need $ out of it.

If that's too much, I also have a Tornado  that takes w in and
/w out for $.
