Hmmm... Interesting. What do you mean by WALKING distance? I lived in
Moscow for  years, and if I am  minutes walk to Belorusskaya
subway station, I CANNOT be walking distance to Kremlin. Unless
 hour of walking is what you mean. By the way, what is
the price? I may plan a trip there (not sure yet, though) in
late summer.
