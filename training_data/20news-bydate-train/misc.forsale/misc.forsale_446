I have a pair of Oakleys that cost about $ new a year ago.  I hardly ever
wore them because they just don't look right on me.  They are orange and
blue and are the "blade" kind (Terminator style).  I am willing to sell these
for $ to the first response I get. 
I also have a Bulls vs. Blazers game for the SNES that is in perfect
condition.  I am selling it for $.  It includes the instruction manual.
