I have a set of four --R Big O tires that I had on my  Thunder 
Bird. We bought them and then traided the car in. They would not give me 
anything for them so I had them taken off. We drove about , miles on 
them. They are , mile tires. They are sporty looking low-profile, and 
take corners realy well. If you are interested please contact me at ()-
 OR DUSMADSO@IDBSU.IDBSU.EDU I am in IDAHO. USA
