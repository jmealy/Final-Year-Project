Second week of January (prime ski season at one of the largest Poconos ski
areas).  Just north of Allentown.
Condo sleeps - depending on how friendly you all are.  Has hot tub,
deck.  Easy access to parking lot and shuttle to slopes (condo is a few
miles from the slopes).

Cost: $ OBRO, price based on what we paid for it (used, also) and
current market.
