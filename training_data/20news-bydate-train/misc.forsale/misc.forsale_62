I am upgrading my computer systems to FAX modems, and am selling my
 // baud USR modems without FAX or error correction.

One is internal ($), the other is external ($). 

Both are U.S. Robotics (the highest rated modem manufacturer).

Add $ shipping or pick up in the Washington DC area.

Offers welcome.  (I would trade either for a xxns SIMM.)
