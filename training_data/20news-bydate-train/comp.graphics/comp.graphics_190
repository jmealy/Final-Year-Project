I have a few reprints left of chapters from my book "Visions of the             
Future".  These include reprints of  chapters probably of interest to          
readers of this forum, including:                                               
                                                                                
. Current Techniques and Development of Computer Art, by Franz Szabo           
                                                                                
. Forging a Career as a Sculptor from a Career as Computer Programmer,         
by Stewart Dickson                                                              
                                                                                
. Fractals and Genetics in the Future by H. Joel Jeffrey                       
                                                                                
I'd be happy to send out free reprints to researchers for scholarly             
purposes, until the reprints run out.                                           
                                                                                
Just send me your name and address.
