Don't get too excited; Signetics, not Motorola, gave the  its number.
The , if I understand rightly, uses the  instruction set, and has
an on-chip serial port and DMA.  (It will run at up to  MHz--I'm typing
at a computer using a  running at that rate, so I know that it can
do so--so I seriously doubt the clock rate that ricardo@rchland.vnet.ibm.com
claims.)
