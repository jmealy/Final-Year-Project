Hi! Everyone,

Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from
 points, I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse
from its offset. For example, given  points on the offset, can you find
the original ellipse analytically?

I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,
but I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinear
programming technique to deal with this problem approximately.

Any ideas will be greatly appreciated. Please post here, let the others
