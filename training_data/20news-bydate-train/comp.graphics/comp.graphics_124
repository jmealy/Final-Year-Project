Has anyone got multiverse to work ?

I have built it on  svr, mips svrs and Sun SparcStation.

There seems to be many bugs in it.  The 'dogfight' and 'dactyl' simply do nothing
(After fixing a bug where a variable is defined twice in two different modules - One needed
setting to static - else the client core-dumped)
