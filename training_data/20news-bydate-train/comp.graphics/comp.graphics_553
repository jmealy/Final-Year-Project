I was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! :-) ) and he made a reference to a
-bit graphics computer/image processing system.  I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or
something akin to that.  Anyway, he claimed it had -bit color + a -bit alpha channel.  That's
 bits of info--what could that possibly be for?  Specifically the -bit color?  That's 
trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve.  Is this an anti-aliasing thing?  Or
is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.

	Also, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are SGI's flagship products?  I know of
Iris, Indigo, and Crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line?
(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC /.  Sigh.)
