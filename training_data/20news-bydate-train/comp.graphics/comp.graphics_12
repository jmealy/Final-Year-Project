I am currently looking for a D graphics library that runs on MS
Windows ..  Are there any such libraries out there other than
Visuallib?  (It must run on VGA and should not require any other
add-on graphics cards).

For Visuallib, will it run with Metaware High C compiler v.?  Any
email contact for the author of Visuallib?

Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks.
