Yes but a key issue is _SPEED_ how fast is Imagine? And is it as easy to
use
as D Studio? Can it just do a render as fast as DS if you don't want
things like IOR etc.. DS can do fine shadows, animated reflection maps,
animated bump maps, animated anything maps, and with the IPAS routines 
(Not that I've ever seen them) It can do explosions, top quality
morphing, fire, rain, lens flares etc..
I'm not knocking imagine, I just want to know how it compares with DS
