: I've been trying to view .tga files created in POVRAY.  I have the Diamond
: SpeedStar  Video board (not the _X_).  So far I can convert them to
: jpeg using cjpeg and view them with CVIEW but that only displays  bit color.
..
: Just want to see the darn things in real color...

I have an ATI ultra pro card, and have found that the easiest way to view
true color images is using their windows drivers and something like winjpeg
or photofinish.  

If anyone has a non-windows solution, I'd love to hear it!
