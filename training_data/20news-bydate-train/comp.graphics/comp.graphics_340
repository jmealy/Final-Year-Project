We have a minivas- and we want to record to an Abekas A.
We have most of the functions working but when we go to
set up a record the minivas hangs. We are sending the
abekas SMPTE time code. Does anyone have code we can
compare to what we have done and is there and ftp site
for minivas and abekas code.
