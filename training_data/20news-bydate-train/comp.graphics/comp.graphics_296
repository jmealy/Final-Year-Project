Hello again netters,
	I finally received the information about Imagine for the PC.  They are presently shipping Version . of the software and will release Version . in the first quarter of  (or so they say).  The upgrade from . to . is $..  To purchase Imagine ., it costs $. or if you are upgrading from another eligible (call them for info) modeler, it is only $. plus shipping & handling.   It requires a PC with  Megs a Math Coprocessor, and Dos . or up and a Microsoft Mouse and SVGA card.
	Thanks for all your replies about the product.  I have received many contrasting replies, but once I scrounge the money together, I think I will take the plunge.  Thanks again.
