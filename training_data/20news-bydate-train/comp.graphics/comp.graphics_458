Greetings,
    I have an Epson HI-  pen plotter forsale.  It emulates an HP 
or  - I'm not sure which.  It has an option board on it that does
the emulation.  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I
also have  Pens for it as follows:   packs of  Black Oil based, 
packs of  Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens,  packs of  Aqueous Black,
 packs of  Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,   pack of  Aqueous Multi color
pens,  and  assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.

    The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for
HP  and HP  and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B
sized paper. (. x  or x).

    I figure that the plotter is worth about $ and the pens are worth at
least another $ more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to
purchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were
sealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem to
function as well.

    I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in
just them.

    I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color.

    I'd like $ or best offer...

    -Chert
