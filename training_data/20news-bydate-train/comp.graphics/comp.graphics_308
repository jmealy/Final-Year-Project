AT&T also puts out two new products for windows, Model numbers elude me now,
a  bit video board with framegrabber and a bit with same. Yesterday I
was looking at a product at a local Software ETC store. Media Vision makes
a bit (, color) frame capture board that is stand alone and doesnot
use the feature connector on your existing video card. It claims upto  fps
live capture as well as single frame from either composite NTSC or s-video
in and out.
