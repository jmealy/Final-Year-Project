By ' grey level images' you mean  items of bit images?
It does work(!), but it doesn't work if you have more than bit
in your screen and if the screen intensity is non-linear.

With  bit per pixel; there could be *c_ + *c_ timing,
this gives  levels, but they are linear if screen intensity is
linear.
With *c_ + *c_ it works, but we have to find the best
compinations -- there's  levels, but  choises; best  must be
chosen. Different compinations for the same level, varies a bit, but
the levels keeps their order.

Readers should verify what I wrote... :-)
