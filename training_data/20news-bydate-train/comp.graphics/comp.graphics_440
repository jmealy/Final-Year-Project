Yes, but... shouldn't size of newsgroup be an issue?  Sorry if this
has been covered before, but comp.grahpics.animation get how much 
traffic per day?   articles?  Maybe  on an extremely heavy day?
I've been following this group for about four months now, and I don't
recall ever seeing such a flood of posts that a split would be warranted.

Just my  cents,
