Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case
with no solution that worried me.

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere 
that they are on the surface of.
Similarly  colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the
surface of.

These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design
meet these problems neatly.

When determining which plane the  points are on if they are colinear
the algorithm should afil or return infinite R.
When intersecting the two lines there are  possibilities
they are the same line  (the  points were on a planar circle)
they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.

This last case can be achieved with  colinier points and any th point
by taking the th point and pairs of the first  parallel lines will be produced

it can also be achieved by

If all  points are coplanar but are not on one circle. 

It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the  points are coplanar.
The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.
( points being colinear => coplanar)
