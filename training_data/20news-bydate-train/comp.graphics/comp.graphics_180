The equation of the sphere through the  points (x,y,z),...,(x,y,z) is
  | x^+y^+z^  x^+y^+z^  ...  x^+y^+z^ |
  |      x             x        ...        x       |
  |      y             y        ...        y       | = 
  |      z             z        ...        z       |
  |                            ...                |
When this  by  determininant is expanded on its first column you get the
equation in the form
  A(x^+y^+z^) + Bx + Cy + Dz + E = 
If you need the center and radius, jyst divide through by A (it cannot be
zero if the  given points form a non-degenerate tetrahedron) and complete
the square on x, y, and z to obtain
  (x-xc)^ + (y-yc)^ + (z-zc)^ = r^
