Okay all my friends are bitching at me that the map I made in Appsoft Draw
can't be displayed in "xv"... I checked... It's true, at least with version
..  My readers on the NeXT have very little trouble on it (Preview messes
up the .eps, but does fine with the TIFF and ImageViewer.a behaves with
flying colors except it doesn't convert worth *&^^% ;-) )

  Please is there any way I can convert this .drw from Appsoft . on the NeXT
to something more reasonable like .gif?  I have access to a sun and NeXTstep
. systems.  any good reliable conversion programs would be helpful... please
email, I'll post responses if anyone wants me to... please email that to.

Yes I used alphachannel... (god i could choke steve jobs right now ;-) )

Yes i know how to archie, but tell me what to archie for ;-)

Also is there a way to convert to .ps plain format? ImageViiewer. turns
out nothing recognizable....
