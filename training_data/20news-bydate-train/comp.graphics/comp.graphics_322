I would like to program Tseng ET to nonstandard x mode by
switching to standard x mode using BIOS and than changing some
timing details (xD registers x-xF) but I don't know how to
select  MHz pixel clock I need. The BIOS function selects  MHz.

Is there anybody who knows where to obtain technical info about this.
I am also interested in any other technical information about Tseng ET
and Trident  and  chipsets.

			thanks very much
