--Minnesota definitely deserves an NHL franchise!!!  You'll see the
Minnesota Whalers pretty soon, so fear not Minnesota fans.  No Norm Green,
'cept for the team color (sorry, bad pun!)

   --What a difference two years makes!  Minnesota finished -- in 
and made the finals.  They finish with a better record at  -- thi year
and move to Dallas.  Every team in the playoffs has a winning record!!!
Finally!!!  It's about time, NHL!!!
