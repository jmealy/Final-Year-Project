According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN, should the Islanders win tonite
the two teams will have the same record, but the Devils will be playing the
Penguins.  This is because the Islanders have won the season series against
the Devils.  I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include:

.  season series
.  goals against
.  goals for

in this order (correct me if I'm wrong).  Anyone have anything to add?
