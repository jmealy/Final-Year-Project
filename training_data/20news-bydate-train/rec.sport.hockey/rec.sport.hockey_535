It is a long standing good luck Redwing's tradition to throw an octopus 
on the ice during a Stanley Cup game. They say it dates back to '
at the Olympia when the Wings became the st team (I think) to sweep 
the cup in  games. A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats
than from the old Olympia balcony, though.
