Well, if things were different and I had my way, the headline would be: "NHL,
European Division regular season game: Stockholm Storm vs. Helsinki Tornado
-..." Two games against every North American-based team ( in all), and this
might have been the ninth and final regular season encounter between Helsinki
and Stockholm. The remaining  games would involve Paris, Dortmund, Milan...
A nice dream.
