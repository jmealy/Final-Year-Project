how do you know this? did lasorda say, before the game, "here's the
lineup i'm using.  i'm batting strawman fourth because the primadonna
insists on batting cleanup"?

if this is true (note that i don't think it is), lasorda should be
fired for at least two reasons:

         ) publicly humiliating his players;
         ) knuckling under to his players wishes.

however, i think that the more likely explanation is that lasorda
wanted strawberry to bat fourth, and that you hate strawberry.
