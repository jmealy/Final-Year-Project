Hello, my friends and I are running the Homewood Fantasy Baseball
League (pure fantasy baseball teams). Unfortunely, we are running the league
using Earl Weaver Baseball II with the Comm. Disk II and we need the stats
for the  season. (Preferably the  Major League Stat Disk) We have
the ' total stats but EWB needs the split stats otherwise we have 
inning games because the Comm. Disk turns total stats into vs. L's stats
unless you know both right and left -handed stats.
