Another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too.
(Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last)


The  Angels were  / game out of th. The Athletics and 
expansion Senators finished tied for last. 
The  Colt 's finshed th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last).
The  Royals finshed th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last).
The  Mariners finished th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).

Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago 
team around is a `good thing'


This may be an appropriate comparison.
The - Yankees finshed nd, rd and nd finshing 
,  and -/ games out of first. 
In ,' and ' they also finished second ( though they were only
,  and  games out).
Even great teams can lose - That's why they play the season.
(on the other hand... I'm still picking the Braves to go all the way)
