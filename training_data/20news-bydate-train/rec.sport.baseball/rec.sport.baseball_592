My dad has always blamed the Phillies collapse in ' on me...  On Sept ,  ,  the Phillies had something like a  game lead with  to play.  I was born on Sept ,  .  The Phils proceeded to lose something like  straight while the Cards won  straight (does anyone know hte exact numbers?),  and a pennant was blown.  To this day my dad likes to remind me that it all began when I was born!
