: I think most of the problems mainly arose from Manager Gene Mauch's
: ineptitude in managing the pitching staff.  Down the stretch, he
: abused Jim Bunning, Chris Short, and Robin Roberts (I think those
: are the three) pitching each on only  days rest for quite some
: time.  By the time they hit the last  weeks of the season,
: obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm.  Oh
: well.

Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in .  Or maybe a
Colt ..  The rd starter was Art Mahaffey, the previous year's ace.
Dennis Bennett was the th starter.

They were indeed . up with  to go, but they won their final two
games after the horrid -loss streak.  The final game victory
(Bunning's th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the
title; they and the Phils were both  game behind the Cards, with the
Giants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead
against the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a -way
tie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the  or so runs they
scored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis.
