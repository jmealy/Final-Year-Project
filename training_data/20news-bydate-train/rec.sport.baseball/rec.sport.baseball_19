Up to this point, I really thought this had been written by a 
pro-SDCN, anti-mediot poster blessed with a certain talent for
sarcasm and biting remarks.  Somebody like me, for instance.
The lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the
original poster.


But then the scales were lifted from my eyes.  Looks like Robert is
really being serious.  Oh, well.

I compare the performance of the  Phillies with the  edition,
which had outstanding run producers at every position except SS, yet
finished at a frustrating sub-. level.  The  folks didn't 
ever amount to anything, and neither will the  squad, IMHO.

Any other parallels with previous years' teams for this year's
editions (in the style of  Braves =  Orioles)?
