This was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game. The
argument was

) Defense, or runs allowed, is % of the game.
) Unearned runs amount to % of the runs allowed; earned runs, %.

) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and
earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is %
of defense and pitching is % of defense.
) Caombining with #, pitching is % of the game, fielding %.

Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in
the -% of defense range; call it - between fielding and
pitching.


I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe -, or
even -. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and
even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot
more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often. (No offense,
Gordon).
