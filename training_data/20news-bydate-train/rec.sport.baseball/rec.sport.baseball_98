I believe we are down to two:  the -day and the -day.  (I don't remember 
a -day, but rather a -day.  Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length 
is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the -day for as long 
as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be 
periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you 
cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not 
wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the -day 
that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I 
believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When 
there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between 
the lists.
