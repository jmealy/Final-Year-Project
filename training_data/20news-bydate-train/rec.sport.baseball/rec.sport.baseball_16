Let's look at the effects of inflation on 's superstars' salaries.

I read once that the Babe made $, one year and that was about as good 
as it got for him.

Let's assume he made that in  (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know
I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)

Today, assuming a % yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if
not accurate, his measly $, salary would be worth.

FV = $, x (+%)^(-)
   = $, x (.)^
   = just over $,,.

Assuming inflation is average of around %.

FV = $, x (+%)^
   = almost ,,.

(I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).

These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly 
overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above
average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and 
average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t 
think I'm off by much.
