Going into the ninth with a  run lead, ... runs score...runners on 
first and second...RD throws, "there's a drive waaaaaayyyyyyy back, 
Puckett to the wall, leaps, He CAUGHT THE BALL!!!!  WHAT A CATCH BY KIRBY!!
TWINS WIN!"  and RD gets the save.  His line  IP,  walks,  hits, and
one robbed home run...
