Last week I posted the ALL-TIME GREATEST PLAYERS (and haphazardly misspelled
several names--SORRY!)  This week, it's time for the greatest PEAK players.
I evaluated the following players on  consectutive seasons which constituted
their "prime" or "peak" years.  ( was too few;  seemed to many--so I settled
for ).  Sources, as usual, include Total Baseball  and my own (biased)
opinions.
Here goes, feel free to comment.

 .  Ted Williams (includes season after war)--missed actual peak years
 .  Babe Ruth
 .  Walter Johnson
 .  Mickey Mantle
 .  Mike Schmidt  (actual peak year shortened by strike)
 .  Barrry Bonds  (currently at peak)
 .  Honus Wagner
 .  Ty Cobb
 .  Tris Speaker
.  Willie Mays
.  Lefty Grove
.  Sandy Koufax

I hope there are some surprises here: Raines above Muisial?  Carter above
 Bench?  Ripken above Banks?  Bonds above Mays?
Check the numbers of each player in comparison to the numbers of the rest
of the players that year(s), and you'll see that I'm fairly close with
this ranking system (which is primarily based on Total Player Rating) for
four consecutive years.
