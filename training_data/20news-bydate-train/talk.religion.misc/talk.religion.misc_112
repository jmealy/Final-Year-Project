Well, there is a fair amount of evidence floating around that indicates
that OTO has been around since at least the late s, long before
Crowley ever heard of it, how long has AMORC been around? (yes, I know
that they claim to have existed as an organization clear into prehistory,
but I doubt that they have any organizational paperwork
as a non-profit that can be carbon-dated to , BC)
