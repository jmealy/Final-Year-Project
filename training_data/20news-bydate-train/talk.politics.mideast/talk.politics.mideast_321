Just to address this one point, what about the two Katyusha rocket 
attacks made within Lebanon, for which Fatah claimed responsibility.
I didn't realize that one can use Katyushas while onr is disarmed.
Also, Page  of today's New York Times, Faisal Saleh, a high ranking 
Fatah official, and his  month old son were gunned down in Beirut 
by members of Abu Nidal.  There have been  assasination attempts 
in  alone in the fued between these two factions, resulting in
 deaths.
