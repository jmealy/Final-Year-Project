Sorry, ARF - you dog,

That news was suppressed because the Israeli national volleyball team
repeatedly spiked it.

Let this be a lesson to others not to invoke the wrath of sports nuts.
(Brits lead the way in this regard, with ~ casualties in the last 
years.)

Anyway, Yigal would never sue.  His life is (presumably) so pristine
that its most intimate details could be revealed without harm to
anyone.  Might even be good instruction for some people I can think of.
