Dear Mr. Karageorgiou,
I would like to clarify several misunderstandings in your posting. First the    bus incident which I believe was in Canakkale three years ago, was done by a    mentally ill person who killed himself afterwards. The Pontus Greeks were ex-   changedwith Turks in Greece in . I have to logout now since my Greek friend
Yiorgos here wants to use the computer. Well, I'll be back.Asta la vista baby.
