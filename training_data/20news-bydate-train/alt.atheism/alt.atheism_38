There is also the question of what is meant by "atheist".  A familiar
example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows.

The two statements following ARE consistent:

() I do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks
() I do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks

The two statements following are NOT consistent:

() I do believe that you are wearing lilac socks
() I do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks

Statements () and () require no faith, they make no presumptions about
the nature of reality.  Statements () and () require belief.  Many
atheists (myself included) take the following position:

() I do not believe that there is a god.
() I do not believe that there is not a god.
