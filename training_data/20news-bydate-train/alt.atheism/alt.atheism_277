If one is a vegan (a vegetarian taht eats no animal products at at i.e eggs, 
milk, cheese, etc., after about  years of a vegan diet, you need to start 
taking B supplements because b is found only in animals.) Acutally our 
bodies make B, I think, but our bodies use up our own B after  or  
years.  
Lacto-oveo vegetarians, like myself, still get B through milk products 
and eggs, so we don't need supplements.
And If anyone knows more, PLEASE post it.  I'm nearly contridicting myself 
with the mish-mash of knowledge I've gleaned.
