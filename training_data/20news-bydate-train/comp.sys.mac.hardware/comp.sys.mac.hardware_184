I'd appreciate it greatly if someone could E-mail me the following:
(if you only know one, that's fine)
) Specs for the  (esp. how it compares to the Pentium)
) Specs for the  with estimated cost, release date, etc...

I'm interested in speeds, systems it can run (Windows NT, RISC, or whatever),
costs, bus info, register info.  All the technical info.

I am hoping that the  can win yet another battle against the intel people.
 
:)  Thanks for any info you can give.

Thanks.
