No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed.
Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and
I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory
system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If
you have a MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory
every ns.  Sure, you can put all ns memory in your computer, but
it will cost  times as much as the slower ns SIMMs.

And roughly, the  is twice as fast at a given clock
speed as is the .
