I've noticed some of you mentioning owning a Quadra  / with CD
and meg of VRAM.  It seems that this configuration was purchased
complete; that is, the CD and VRAM were already installed in the box. 
I am interested in that exact configuration and will be buying with an
educational discount but have not found the CD bundled with any Q
smaller than the /.
If you bought or know how to buy the / with CD installed, please let
me know what you know via email:
send messages to dmaluso@mhc.mtholyoke.edu
Thanks, all.
