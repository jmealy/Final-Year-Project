Greetings!!

	I planning to upgrade my Mac IIsi:

		() from the present Megs to Megs;
	and	() add a Math-Coprocessor.

	Technology Works, of Austin (Texas) comes quite highly recommended by 
some Mac magazines.  I was just wonderring if anyone could share with me 
anything about Tech Works (both good and bad experiences); or give any advice
about other mail-order companies that I may consider.

	Your reply would be very much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
