Hi folks

I'm planning to buy a LCIII but need advice on choosing a monitor.
What do people recommend for a decent "/" monitor?  

I'v looked at some ads and the spec for NEC FG/FGe and the price is 
within my budget, but could LCIII be able to use the various resolutions 
available on FG (specifically the x resolution)? Does LCIII only 
support one resolution?

Also any recommendations for a reliable mail order place for LCIII or
monitors? Does anyone have experience with the following mail-order places?

	SYEX EXPRESS 	(Houston, Tx)
	USA FLEX 	(Bloomingdale, Il)

Thanks,

jeff
