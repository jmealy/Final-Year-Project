With a little luck, I could own a C sometime in the near future, and
so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:

.  What speed SIMMS does the C need/want?  (I know that it needs ns
VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)

.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
C's RAM... and  megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing
would be better:  does the  meg version come with all  megs on the logic
board, or  megs + a  meg SIMM?)

Just wondering....
