I have tested this on a  and it does work there.  So it would
seem that the  and  are out though.  One way to tell is to
go and open the PowerBook control panel(.).  There is a setting
there that allows you to set the time to wake up the Mac.  If it
is present when you open the control panel, then you can assume that
SetWUTime will work.
