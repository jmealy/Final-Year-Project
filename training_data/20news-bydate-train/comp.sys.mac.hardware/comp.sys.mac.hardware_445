I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video
in my IIci and to get  bit color capability on my " monitor. What's
the deal on them?

) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the max
and min? How much do I need for  x  x  bits?

) What bit depths are supported? One, , , , , and ?

) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that
modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What
bit depths are accelerated, all or just  bit? I've heard that some
applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly
to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem?
How much slower is it?

) Didn't I read (when System  first came out) that the card was
incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT,
or other)? Has it been kept compatible with .? Are there many other
apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non-
Microsloth) apps, for example)?

) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position,
let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.

Thanks a lot for you input.
Rick
