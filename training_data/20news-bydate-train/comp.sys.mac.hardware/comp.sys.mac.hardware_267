Hi... what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have (if
they want to go at least  baud)?

Every place in town says they are back ordered, and part of the reason
I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from
wherever I am, but I really would hate to have to wait  months to get
a modem in or have to settle with  baud.
