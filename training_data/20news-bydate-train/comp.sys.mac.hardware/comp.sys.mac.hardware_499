The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system
 on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC?  I
recall there being a conversation here that a / running Windows benchmarks
at about the same speed as Mhz  in system .  I don't know if that is
true, but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this.
