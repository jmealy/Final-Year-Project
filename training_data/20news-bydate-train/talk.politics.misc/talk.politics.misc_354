s,

This country is hardly ruined. In fact, it is booming compared to after the
 election.

This whole "USA has gone to hell and Reagan/Bush caused it", is not only lame,
pathetic, and old....... it's wrong.

Under Reagan/Bush the economy grew by . trillion dollars.  This is more than 
the entire economy of Germany, a "kind, gentle" country, in many peoples' 
books.  What a joke.
