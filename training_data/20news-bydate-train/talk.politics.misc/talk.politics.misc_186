Fishing rights are disputed.  Between  nations, no matter *how* 
friendly, there is ALWAYS fishing disputes.

What I was getting at was the  ' or fight slogan is OLD STUFF
dealing with the LAND dispute.  No one is saying  ' or fight 
about fishing rights.  The territorial dispute about the Oregon
Territory (we called it) is LONG resolved.

Fishing rights...small potatoes.
