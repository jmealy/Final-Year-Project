Unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented
here either.  Due to rounding, the  est. for LSD could be anywhere
from . to . and the  est. could be anywhere from . to ..
This means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in the
first place) was anywhere from % to %.  Similarly the increase in
cocaine use could be anywhere from % to % and the increase of
crack use could be anywhere from % to %.  This doesn't even
take into account the margin of error which isn't provided here.
