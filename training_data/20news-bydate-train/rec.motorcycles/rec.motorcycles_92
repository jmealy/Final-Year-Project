Never had any problem with mine...

Are you *SURE* the nut/bolt you are trying is really a /" hex?  mm
is just slightly larger...  and a / wrench won't fit on a GM mm
nut (my  GMC pickup has several mm nuts on it...  really annoying, metric
threads too.  Seems that most of the body is metric, most of the engine is
SAE).
