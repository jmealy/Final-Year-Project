Prestone.  I buy it at ShopKo for less 
than that a _gallon_.    BMW has even more
expensive stuff than Kawasaki (must be 
from grapes only grown in certain parts of
the fatherland), but BMW Dave* said "Don't 
worry about it -- just change it yearly and
keep it topped off".  It's been keeping 
Gretchen happy  since ', so I guess it's OK.

Kept my Rabbit's aluminum radiator hoppy for
 years and , miles, too, so I guess
it's aluminum safe. 

*Former owner of the late lamented Rochester 
BMW Motorcycles and all around good guy.
