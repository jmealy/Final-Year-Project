I am in complete concordance with you there, Mike.  I was a Silver StarRider
instructor, for a while.  I learn't about countersteering last year
and I have been riding bikes since .  We were never told about
countersteering when being taught to instruct.  It doesn't seem to have
affected me or my friends or pupils.  We just rode in blissful ignorance.
