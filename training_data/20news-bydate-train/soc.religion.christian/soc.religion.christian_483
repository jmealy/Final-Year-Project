unloving and ineffective, I'm a little disturbed by the formulation that
ill temper is not a Christian trait. It seems like a false argument to
say that anyone who displays trait X must not be a Christian. Could
well be a sinning Christian, but a Christian nonetheless.
Anger is human, and Christians are
human: Christians get angry and defensive and react badly just like
everyone else. It's not perfect righteousness but the effort of seeking
righteousness that marks a dedicated Christian. And one of the greatest
gifts of faith to me is that of seeking and accepting forgiveness for
my failures. Expecting flawless behavior from self or others isn't
Christianity: it's perfectionism.
