 ========================================================================
A couple of points on this thread.

. We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger
   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.

. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is
   not dependent on "sophisticated tools"  (CASE tools?).  However, tools
   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle
   Language) is somewhat limited.

. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated "Level " by a NASA team.
   This group generates - KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.

. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info
   on our software development process.
