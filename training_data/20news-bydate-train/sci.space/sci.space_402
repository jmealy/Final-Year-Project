Here is a computation I did a long time ago that computes the length
of the daylight.  You should be able to convert the information here
to sunrise and sunset times.

======================================================================
Definitions:

z = the tilt of the axis of the planet away from the normal to its
orbital plane.  In case of the Earth z is about . degrees, I think.
I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost
 degrees.

u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured.
Paris is at about  degrees.  North pole is at .

a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from
 to  degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun.
The spring equinox occurs at a=.

L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day).
On the equator (u=) L is always /.  Near the north pole (u= degrees)
L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.

Computation:
Define the auxiliary angles p and q by:
sin p = sin a sin z
cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       ( < q <  degrees)

Conclusion:
L = q /    (if q is measured in degrees)
L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)

Wait!  But what is h?
The cutoff function h is defined as follows:

h (s) = s    if  |s| < 
      =     if   s > 
      = -   if   s < 

As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows
how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year.
Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles.
Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below
the arctic circle.
