Hmm.  $ billion, lesse... I can probably launch  tons to LEO at
$ million, in five years, which gives about  tons to the lunar
surface one-way.  Say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its
fuel, a bigger Mercury or something (might get that as low as two
tons), leaving fifteen tons for a one-man habitat and a year's supplies?
Gee, with that sort of mass margins I can build the systems off
the shelf for about another hundred million tops.  That leaves
about $ million profit.  I like this idea -)  Let's see
if you guys can push someone to make it happen -) -)
