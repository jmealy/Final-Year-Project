The Proton has been used in , , and  stage versions.  The two stage version
was used for the first  launches, while the  and  stage versions are used
today.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)
orbits, while the  stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is
the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir),
as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit
under the shroud.

I vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH/LOX upper stage for the
Proton.
