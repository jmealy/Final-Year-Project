Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their
ERL- resin with T carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive
strength of , psi.  It has a density of . lb/cu in,
therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column
that can just support itself is . million inches, or , ft,
or  Statute miles.

Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss
type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.
Let us assume that we will operate at % of the theoretical 
strength.  This gives a working height of  miles for a constant
section column.  

A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can
build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section
as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a , pound
load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in
calculation).  This requires . square inches of column cross
sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure
below the payload will itself weigh , lb, so at  mile 
below the payload, the total load is now , lb, a .% increase.

The next mile of structure must be .% thicker in cross section
to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile
of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way
to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical
limit on area, although there will be practical limits based
on how much composites we can afford to by at $/lb, and how
much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need
a foundation that the bedrock can support.

Let us arbitrarily choose $ billion as the limit in costruction
cost.  With this we can afford perhaps ,, lb of composites,
assuming our finished structure costs $/lb.  The $/lb figure
is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass
ratio of .:.  At a .% mass ratio per mile, the tower
height becomes  miles.  This is clearly above the significant
atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still
have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses
will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of
rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,
but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus
they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting
from the ground have a % velocity penalty to contend with.

This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind
loads.  These will require more structural support over the first
 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low
enough value for it not to be a big factor.
