Excerpts from netnews.comp.windows.x: -Apr- Monthly Question about
XCop.. Buzz Moschetti@bear.com () 


Hmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all
forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any
internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual
appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens
to be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after
updating the datastructures though...
