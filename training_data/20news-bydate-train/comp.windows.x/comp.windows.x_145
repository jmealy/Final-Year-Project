Is it possible to run an MIT R based Xserver on a Sun with a Rasterops TC
Colorboard (bit board)?  I have the Xsun patches for supporting sun's
bit frame buffers but does the rasterops appear as if its a cgtwelve or
something else?  I know nothing about the rasterops other than we might be
buying one to put in an IPX.
