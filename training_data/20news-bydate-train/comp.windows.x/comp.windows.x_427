i am in need of a motif-based graphing package to integrate into a large
software package under development for distribution to universities.  it
can be either public domain or commercial, although a commercial package
can't have royalties required for binary only distribution.  we need -d
graphing capabilities at a minimum, but -d  would be nice.  any info would
be appreciated and i will summarize if there is interest.

thanks,
mitch
