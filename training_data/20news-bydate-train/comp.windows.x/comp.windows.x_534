I've been offerred an old -bits/pixel greyscale Xterminal.  Aside from the
"real people have already upgraded to RISC architecture R servers", do I want
this Xterminal? 

I'm concerned about the -planes...I've only ever heard of  (mono) and 
(colour) planes -- will I have any concerns with this -plane unit? 
[Specifically related to -planes vs  or ]

Thanks!
