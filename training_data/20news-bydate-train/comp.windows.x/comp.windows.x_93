I'm trying to set up an IPX for another group. I copied all the
X stuff that I compiled on my / (which runs SunOS ..) using
gcc ., and most things run just fine. however, I did find a
couple of bugs, and when I try to recompile those clients on the IPX
(which runs ..), I get

ld: Undefined symbol
   _XShapeQueryExtension
   _XShapeCombineMask

I know that I can include libXext and get rid of those messages,
but I can't figure out why I get them on the IPX and not on the
/. any ideas?
