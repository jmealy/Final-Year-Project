I want to press a function key and have a text string appear in an
XmText widget.  When I put

	*XmText.Translations: #augment \n\
		<Key>F:  insert-string(HELLO)

in my resource file, the translation doesn't happen.  If I put

	*XmText.Translations: <Key>F:  insert-string(HELLO)

in the file, I get the text string HELLO when F is pressed, but no other 
keys work, which makes sense since the default translation mode is "replace".  

	Do I have a syntax problem here, or something deeper?
