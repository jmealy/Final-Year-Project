I've installed XR with patches for Solaris . on our SPARCstation LX /
SPARCclassic pool. On the LX, XR runs fine, but on the classics,
after giving the command startx, Xsun prints the following messages:
	WARNING: cg_mmap: can't map dummy space!
	Mapping cgc: No such device or address
and exits.

Does anybody know how to fix this problem?

Thanks in advance.
