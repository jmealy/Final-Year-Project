Hi,
I have a problem when compiled Wcl . in SCO ODT .:


        cc -c -Ox  -I.. -I/usr/include XtGetResL.c
XtGetResL.c
XtGetResL.c() : error C: '_XtConstraintBit' : undefined
*** Error code 

Although I follow the instructions in file README_BUILD to build Wcl in SCO 
platform, this problem didn't resolve.

So I have some questions related to this matter:
