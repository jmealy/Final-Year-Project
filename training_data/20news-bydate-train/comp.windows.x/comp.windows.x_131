The following problem is really bugging me,
and I would appreciate any help.

I create two windows:

w (child to root) with event_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask;
w (child to w) with do_not_propagate_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask;


Keypress events in w are discarded, but ButtonPress events fall through
to w, with subwindow set to w.

FYI, I'm using xnews/olvwm.

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here?
