Subject:  )! Where can I get a WYSIWYG interface builder?

	A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works 
with XR and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:
  This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user
  interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates
  "Wc - Widget Creation" resource files and this distribution also includes the
  Widget Creation Library (version ., with the exception of the demos and
  Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth.
Check dirt.README, dirt.A..tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

Subject:  )  TOPIC: BUILDING THE X DISTRIBUTION [topic needs updating to R]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  )  What's a good source of information on configuring the X build?

	This FAQ includes information on a number of "gotchas" that can bite 
you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on 
building the X release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled 
separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your 
sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at 
the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the 
xstuff mail server.
	In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume  on X Administration
includes information on configuring and building X.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  )  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg work with R?

	Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all
Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix- 
may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  )  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS . know about _dlsym, etc.?

	If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with 
libdl.a.  Add "-ldl" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to 
surround it with "-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES
variable, since "syslibs" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual 
compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile 
the stubs shared.)

[thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM), /]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  )  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS ..?

	In SunOS .. Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way XR builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be
undefined when building some X clients: 
	_get_wmShellWidgetClass
	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" appears to work. 

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows . (XR-based Xt), please 
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:

Patch i.d.      Description
-       ..x OpenWindows . libXt Jumbo patch
-       ..x OpenWindows . undefined symbols when using
                        shared libXmu

[Greg Earle, earle@Sun.COM; /] 

A source patch for use with the MIT XR libraries was developed by Conrad 
Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R some fixes made in R to
get around this problem. The patch is on export in [/]
	contrib/XR_sunos.._patch_version.Z

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  )  Why can't gcc compile XR on my SPARC?
I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation
faults when running X.

	Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
x or VAX platforms.

	Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing 
structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when 
gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or 
return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and 
the server.

	This is from the GCC manual:

	On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for 
	structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument
	list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by 
	reference.

	This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet
	supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.

	The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and
	`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.

You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with 
compilation flags.  

	Files which need to be compiled using cc include:
		server/os/.bsd/oscolor.c 
		rgb/rgb.c

	In addition, several of the "inet_" functions use structs as args or
return values:  
		clients/xhost/xhost.c 
		clients/xauth/gethost.c. 
Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly 
harmless as they don't involve structs.

Subject:  )  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?
When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error 
	"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. 
	Fatal server bug! no screens found."

	Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do 
this simple test:

	#include <sys/ioctl.h>
	SIOCGIFCONF

Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of 
interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like 
whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your 
fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc
sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are 
identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

Subject:  )  What are these problems compiling XR on the older Sun?
In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCGC.c, we have found "missing" defines for 
CGAC_MONOLEN, CGBC_MONOLEN, CGAC_ENBLEN, CGBC_ENBLEN. What should these be?

	The R Errata list distributed after XR mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. .) to compile:
        #define CGAC_MONOLEN (*)
        #define CGAC_ENBLEN  CGAC_MONOLEN
        #define CGBC_MONOLEN CGAC_MONOLEN
        #define CGBC_ENBLEN  CGAC_MONOLEN

	However, the Sun should not actually ever have the CG device, and so 
references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the 
Imakefile.  [/]

Subject: )  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS ..?
The file <sundev/cgreg.h> isn't being found.

	Sun omitted <sundev/cgreg.h> from SunOS ... Remove the #include 
from sunCGC.c and replace it with the line 
	#define CG_VADDR_COLOR   x
The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied 
from another distribution.

Subject: )  What are these problems using R shared libraries on SunOS ?
All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:
	ld.so: libXmu.so.: not found
or even:
	ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from xfac

	If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you 
need to run "ldconfig" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've
installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While 
building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid 
linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those 
distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  
If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that 
the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or 
/usr/lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked 
statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]
	Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it
attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.
You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to
most C compilers).

Subject: )  Can OLIT programs run with R Xt? (_XtQString undefined)

This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in 
XR (upon which OW .'s libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was 
removed in XR (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R and R
libraries only applied to the documented interface).  

A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the XR
or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

Subject: )  How do I get around the SunOS . security hole?

	There is a security problem with certain R clients (xterm and xload)
running under SunOS . that have been installed setuid root and are using 
shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:
	) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used
by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site.
	) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).
	) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries.

[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), /]

The R version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the
newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this 
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. 
Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.

Subject: )  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?

	On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits 
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by 
accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console 
display. Check the man page for fbtab().

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  What is Imake?

	Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a
makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-
processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles 
suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not 
specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the 
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.
	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by
which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration
files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not 
obvious.
	There have been several different versions of imake; the R, R, and
R versions are different.

	You can obtain information on imake from these sources:
	- the R and R release notes and imake man page include information on
using Imake to build X
	- the R and R file mit/config/README also contains useful information
	- on the R tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R/R
guide to imake.
	- the R mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim
Fulton on an early version of Imake
	- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful 
explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-
supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu
in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-XR.ms (troff) and 
config-XR.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. 
[/: document version is now .] These imake papers are available by email;
mail a message body of "send imake-stuff help" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.
	- see "System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?" by Dinah McNutt
in the November  issue of SunExpert.
	- German readers should expect in June  an article "Das Meta-Make 
/ I make, you make / Schwerelos" by Rainer Klute in "iX 
Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin", directed at application programmers needing to
write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The
X Journal, issue :.
	- The O'Reilly X Resource issue # contains Paul Davey's article on
demystifying Imake.
	- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in 
sasun.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile..Z.

[/;/;/;/]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  Where can I get imake?

	Versions are distributed with the R and R releases. An earlier 
version is distributed with the XR release; some third-party toolkits 
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the 
template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such 
configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the 
templates distributed with XR.
	export contains the R distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution.
	A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from XR, is in
ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (...).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?

	If you have R or R installed on your system, run "xmkmf". This is a 
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a 
Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, 
which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?
When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:
	Undefined:
	_XShapeQueryExtension
	_XShapeCombineMask

	These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)
which was introduced in the MIT XR distribution and allows non-rectangular
windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will 
only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-XR servers, as well as many 
vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case 
they will display rectangular windows anyway.

	In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library 
libXext.a.  In the XR distribution, this library and the associated includes
will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do 
not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be 
compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X 
libraries.

Subject: )  What are these problems with "_XtInherit not found" on the Sun?
When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS .. or . machine I get the 
error "ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit".

	What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R libXt.a to 
get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that 
is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting 
_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby 
guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where 
XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally
be called.

	You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. 
	) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a 
connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's .. UIL had this problem; it called
XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your 
program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.
	) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is
correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView 
program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. 

	It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,
although this will certainly solve the problem.

Subject: )  Why can't I compile my R Xaw contrib programs under the new X?
I have a program that worked well under XR. When I try to link it under 
the current version of X, I get this message:
	Undefined:
	_XtScrollBarSetThumb
	_XtTextSetInsertionPoint
	_XtTextReplace

	There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition
to the header files moving into <X/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R
release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but
are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?

	The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are
called "hints" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you
can use something like the following:

        XWMHints wmhints;
        ...
        wmhints.flags = InputHint;
        wmhints.input = True;
        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)

If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput 
resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have
source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.

Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having 
this done. 

	If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.
	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true

[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  How do I figure out what window manager is running?

	You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case. 
	For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so 
long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in 
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can 
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may 
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order
to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window 
manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;
this surely leads to future compatibility problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  Is there a skeleton X program available?
	
	There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the 
Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development 
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional 
development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive 
application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good
applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to "test just 
this one little thing" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R program that 
puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for
quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R and R 
distributions, and the Xlib "Hello World" example in the R doc/HelloWorld and 
R doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R 
Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in / to comp.windows.x  
by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[/]

	In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute 
showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display 
connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [/]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?

	The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:
	{
	Arg args[];
	int i;
	int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */
	i=;
	XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;
	XtGetValues(widget, args, i );
	...
	}

But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; 
declaring the variable "sensitive" as Boolean works properly. This problem 
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types 
Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar 
problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.
[/]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?

	You're probably trying to use these functions from application code.
They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a 
parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising 
functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use 
only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.
	The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.
Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your
application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the 
widgets' data becoming corrupted.
	[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be 
avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: )  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?

	Although there are various details of the current implementation of
the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no
such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for
the "new" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location
in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?
What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are
defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old 
widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired 
resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in 
creating a new widget.

	Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.
