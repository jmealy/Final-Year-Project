I'd like to compile Xr on a Sony NWS- running NEWS .c.  The
X distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say
it has been tested on the machine.  BUT, also in the release notes,
nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I
supposed to use for my r X server then?  How can the OS be supported,
but not the hardware? Is there something in the r binaries that can
be used as the r server? These may seem like silly questions, but
I'm *really* confused.
