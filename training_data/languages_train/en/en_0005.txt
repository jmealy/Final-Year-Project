Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[28] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[24] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"[29] was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[24] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[30]
